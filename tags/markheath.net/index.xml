            I&#39;m very pleased to announce my latest Pluralsight / A Cloud Guru course - Azure Functions Deep Dive. This is a completely new course, using v4 of the Azure Functions runtime and the isolated programming model. It has taken me many months to complete, so apologies that I&#39;ve been fairly quiet on here most of this year. In the course I try to cover all of the most popular triggers and bindings, as well as looking at Durable Functions and some of the options for deployment and monitoring.
