            I recently posted about how to get started calling LLMs with C# using the Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package. The model we chose to use was gpt-4o-mini, which has the advantage of being &amp;quot;multimodal&amp;quot;, as it can accept not only text input, but images as well. In this post I&#39;ll show how you can pass an image to this model using Microsoft.Extensions.AI and ask it to describe the image. It&#39;s relatively straightforward, but as always seems to be the case with these things, there was a gotcha I ran into.

            AI opens up a lot of exciting possibilities for developers to use its capabilities within their own applications, but it can feel a bit overwhelming getting started. You have a lot of choices around which models to use and how best to interact with them. In this post I want to go through the steps to implement a basic chat with an LLM hosted in Azure using C#, by taking advantage of the new Microsoft.
