            I&#39;m pleased to announce my latest Pluralsight course, Refactor and Optimize Code with GitHub Copilot, has just gone live. It will be part of a series of courses covering various aspects of using GitHub Copilot, and my course focuses specifically on using Copilot to refactor, modernize and optimize code. This is an important topic as many of us are spending a lot of time working on existing legacy codebases, and learning to use GenAI effectively with these projects is a great investment of your time.
