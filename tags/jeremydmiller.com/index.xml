            We were able to publish the Wolverine 3.13.4 release this morning with a handful of important fixes for error retries in a modular monolith architecture, recovering from Rabbit MQ connection interruptions, and Azure Service Bus, Kafka, and Amazon SQS fixes. The awesome part of this release was how much of it, including a huge fix … Continue reading Symbolically Important Wolverine 3.13.4 Release →

            One of the earliest lessons I learned designing software systems is that reigning in unchecked growth of databases through judicious pruning and archiving can do wonders for system performance over time. As yet another tool in the toolbox for scaling Marten and in collaboration with a JasperFx Software customer, we’re adding an important feature in … Continue reading Stream Compacting in Marten 8.0 →

            Time for an update on Critter Stack release plans, and a follow up on my previous Critter Stack Work in Progress post from March. The current plan is to release Marten 8.0, Weasel 8.0, and Wolverine 4.0 on June 1st. It’s not going to be a huge release in terms of new functionality, but there … Continue reading Critter Stack Release Plans →

Wolverine is a powerful tool for command and event message processing, and it comes with a lot of built in options for wide range of … Continue reading Message Concurrency, Parallelism, and Ordering with Wolverine →
