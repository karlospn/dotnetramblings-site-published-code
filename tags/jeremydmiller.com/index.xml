            This is continuing a series about multi-tenancy with Marten, Wolverine, and ASP.Net Core: In previous posts I’ve described first why multi-tenancy might be useful, how to do it with Marten’s “conjoined” tenancy model, and lastly how to do it with separate databases for each tenant. Marten is more flexible than that though, and it’s sometimes valid to … Continue reading Multi-Tenancy: Mixed Modes with Marten →

            If you’re not familiar with it, Lamar is an IoC/DI container for .NET. It was originally built to be a faster, modernized, ASP.Net Core-compliant replacement for the much older StructureMap IoC library and also as a necessary subsystem of what is now Wolverine. First off, if you have a vested investment in continuing to use … Continue reading Retiring Lamar and the Ghost of IoC Containers Past →

To go even farther, I would like there to be a day where organizations purposely choose the .NET ecosystem just because of the … Continue reading The “Critter Stack” Just Leveled Up on Modular Monolith Support →
