            In this article, we are going to discuss how to perform snapshot testing on objects using the Verify library. Testing is an important part of our software development pipeline. As developers, we often rely on familiar testing approaches like unit testing, where we assert the behavior of individual components of an application, and integration testing, […] The post How to Perform Snapshot Testing With Verify in C# appeared first on Code Maze.

            In this article, we’ll explain the AsyncLocal class and how to persist values across an async flow with the AsyncLocal class in C#. We’ll start by describing the challenge that AsyncLocal solves and continue with examples of how it does that. We’ll scratch the surface of the AsyncLocal inner workings and finish with the cases […] The post Persist Values With AsyncLocal in C# Async Flow appeared first on Code Maze.
