            In C#, method binding refers to associating a method call with the method’s code definition. When we invoke a method, the program determines which specific method to execute. This process, known as “binding,” can occur at two different times: during compile-time (early binding) or runtime (late binding). By using early binding, we can use compile-time […] The post Early Binding and Late Binding in C# appeared first on Code Maze.

            In this article, we’ll introduce pointers in C#, exploring their syntax, usage in unsafe code blocks, and practical applications with direct memory manipulation. We’ll also discuss considerations involved in using pointers in a managed language. Let’s start! What Is a Pointer in C#? A pointer is simply a variable that holds the memory address of […] The post How to Use Pointers in C# appeared first on Code Maze.
