            Unit testing IServiceCollection registrations in .NET enables us to test our application’s IServiceCollection to confirm that the setup of dependency injection is correct, allowing us to catch errors early in development. E.g. if we fail to register a service or register a service incorrectly with the wrong lifetime, we would be able to detect such […] The post How to Test IServiceCollection Registrations in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            Entity Framework Core (EF Core) has many powerful features, with Interceptors being one of the most versatile. Interceptors allow us to plug in custom behavior at different stages of the EF Core operation pipeline, giving us enhanced control over data interaction processes. Moreover, by using interceptors, we can fine-tune our database operations, enforce business rules, […] The post Using EF Core Interceptors in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            In this article, we are going to explore how to generate images in an ASP.NET Core application using OpenAI. Let’s get going. Introduction to OpenAI Models OpenAI has developed a range of specialized AI models, of which the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series lays the groundwork for numerous natural language processing applications. Codex takes this […] The post Generate Images Using OpenAI in an ASP.NET Core Application appeared first on Code Maze.
