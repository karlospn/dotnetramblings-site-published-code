            2025 was the year software teams stopped optimizing models and started optimizing systems. By December, a few truths were impossible to ignore. 1. Developer Productivity Became the Real Competitive Advantage By mid-year, every major AI lab had cleared the “good enough reasoning” bar. With model quality converging, the differentiator was no longer raw intelligence. It...

            Docker Captains are leaders from the developer community that are both experts in their field and are passionate about sharing their Docker knowledge with others. “From the Captain’s Chair” is a blog series where we get a closer look at one Captain to learn more about them and their experiences. Today we are interviewing Igor...

            Earlier this week, we took a major step forward for the industry. Docker Hardened Images (DHI) is now available at no cost, bringing secure-by-default development to every team, everywhere. Anyone can now start from a secure, minimal, production-ready foundation from the first pull, without a subscription. With that decision comes a responsibility: if Docker Hardened Images become...

            Containers are the universal path to production for most developers, and Docker has always been the steward of the ecosystem. Docker Hub has over 20 billion monthly pulls, with nearly 90% of organizations now relying on containers in their software delivery workflows. That gives us a responsibility: to help secure the software supply chain for...

            Voice is the next frontier of conversational AI. It is the most natural modality for people to chat and interact with another intelligent being. However, the voice AI software stack is complex, with many moving parts. Docker has emerged as one of the most useful tools for AI agent deployment. In this article, we&#39;ll explore...

            Running large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models can be a complex, frustrating process of managing dependencies, drivers, and environments. At Docker, we believe this should be as simple as docker model run. That&#39;s why we built Docker Model Runner, and today, we’re thrilled to announce a new collaboration with Universal Blue. Thanks...

            Most discussions about Model Context Protocol infrastructure ask how to govern thousands of AI tools and monitor which MCP servers are running. This question is table stakes but undershoots the possibilities. A better question is how we can unleash MCP to drive developer creativity from a trusted foundation. The first question produces a phone book...
