            How developers are embedding runtime security to safely build with AI agents Introduction: When AI Workflows Become Attack Surfaces The AI tools we use today are powerful, but also unpredictable and exploitable. You prompt an LLM and it generates a Dockerfile. It looks correct. A shell script? Reasonable. You run it in dev. Then something...

            Docker, Inc.®, a provider of cloud-native and AI-native development tools, infrastructure, and services, today announced the acquisition of MCP Defender, a company founded to secure AI applications. The rapid evolution of AI-from simple generative models to powerful agentic tools-has transformed software development in extraordinary ways. But as with all powerful technologies, new capabilities bring new...

            Running large AI models in the cloud gives access to immense capabilities, but it doesn’t come for free. The bigger the models, the bigger the bills, and with them, the risk of unexpected costs. Local models flip the equation. They safeguard privacy and keep costs predictable, but their smaller size often limits what you can...

            MCP is not an API. Tools are not agents. MCP is more than tools. Here’s what this means in practice. Most developers misread the Model Context Protocol because they map it onto familiar API mental models. That mistake breaks agent designs, observability, and the “last mile” where non-deterministic reasoning must meet deterministic execution. This piece...
