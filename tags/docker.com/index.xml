            With the release of Docker Compose v2.36.0, we&#39;re excited to introduce a powerful new feature: provider services. This extension point opens up Docker Compose to interact not only with containers but also with any kind of external system, all while keeping the familiar Compose file at the center of the workflow. In this blog post,...

            Since releasing the Docker MCP Toolkit, we’ve seen strong community adoption, including steady growth in MCP server usage and over 1 million pulls from the Docker MCP Catalog. With the community, we’re laying the groundwork by standardizing how developers define, run, and share agent-based workloads with Docker Compose. Now, we’re expanding on that foundation with...

            Docker Hub has become an essential resource for developers worldwide, serving 11 billion monthly image downloads and hosting over 14 million container images. As agentic AI proliferates, we&#39;re seeing a significant shift in how developers work. More and more developers are leveraging MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to power their AI agents and automated workflows....

            Nobody wants a spineless application development process. What do I mean by this? The spine is the backbone that supports and provides nerve channels for the human body. Without it, we would be floppy, weaker, and would struggle to understand how our extremities were behaving. A slightly tortured analogy, but consider the application lifecycle of...

            We recently launched a new, reimagined Docker MCP Catalog with improved discovery and a new submission process. Containerized MCP servers offer a secure way to run and scale agentic applications and minimize risks tied to host access and secret management. Developers can submit servers in two ways: Docker-built servers, which include our full security suite...
