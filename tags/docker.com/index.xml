            This is Part 4 of our MCP Horror Stories series, where we examine real-world security incidents that expose the devastating vulnerabilities in AI infrastructure and demonstrate how Docker MCP Gateway provides enterprise-grade protection against sophisticated attack vectors. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has transformed how developers integrate AI agents with their development environments. Tools like...

            The world of local AI is moving at an incredible pace, and at the heart of this revolution is llama.cpp—the powerhouse C++ inference engine that brings Large Language Models (LLMs) to everyday hardware (and it’s also the inference engine that powers Docker Model Runner). Developers love llama.cpp for its performance and simplicity. And we at...

            cagent is a new open-source project from Docker that makes it simple to build, run, and share AI agents, without writing a single line of code. Instead of writing code and wrangling Python versions and dependencies when creating AI agents, you define your agent&#39;s behavior, tools, and persona in a single YAML file, making it...

            At Docker, open source is not just something we support; it&#39;s a core part of our culture. It’s part of our DNA. From foundational projects like Docker Compose (35.5k stars, 5.4k forks) and Moby (69.8k stars, 18.8k forks) to our continued code contributions, we remain committed to strengthening the open-source ecosystem. Today, we are announcing...

            We’re excited to share that Docker Model Runner is now generally available (GA)! In April 2025, Docker introduced the first Beta release of Docker Model Runner, making it easy to manage, run, and distribute local AI models (specifically LLMs). Though only a short time has passed since then, the product has evolved rapidly, with continuous...

            In the recent article, Building Isolated AI Code Environments with Cerebras and Docker Compose, our friends at Cerebras showcased how one can build a coding agent to use worlds fastest Cerebras’ AI inference API, Docker Compose, ADK-Python, and MCP servers. In this post, we’ll dive deeper into the underlying technologies and show how the pieces...

            Since its release by Anthropic in November 2024, Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained massive adoption and is quickly becoming the connective tissue between AI agents and the tools, APIs, and data they act on. With just a few lines of configuration, an agent can search code, open tickets, query SaaS systems, or even deploy...
