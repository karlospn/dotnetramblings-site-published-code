            Intro Local development can be challenging when apps rely on external services like databases or queues, leading to brittle scripts and inconsistent environments. Fiber v3 and Testcontainers solve this by making real service dependencies part of your app’s lifecycle, fully managed, reproducible, and developer-friendly. With the upcoming v3 release, Fiber is introducing a powerful new...

            At Docker, we always believe in the power of community and collaboration. It reminds me of what Robert Axelrod said in The Evolution of Cooperation: “The key to doing well lies not in overcoming others, but in eliciting their cooperation.” And what better place for Docker Model Runner to foster this cooperation than at Hugging...

            The non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes them ideal for generating dynamic, rich test data, perfect for validating app behavior and ensuring consistent, high-quality user experiences. Today, we’ll walk you through how to use Docker’s Model Runner with Microcks to generate dynamic mock APIs for testing your applications. Microcks is a powerful CNCF tool that allows...

            When thinking about starting a Generative AI (GenAI) project, you might assume that Python is required to get started in this new space. However, if you’re already a Java developer, there’s no need to learn a new language. The Java ecosystem offers robust tools and libraries that make building GenAI applications both accessible and productive....

            Agents are the future, and if you haven’t already started building agents, you probably will soon. Across industries and use cases, agents can act on our behalf, and offload repetitive work, because they can act on our behalf with judgment and context. But while agentic development is moving fast, today it’s tedious, hard, and not...
