            We’re thrilled to bring NVIDIA DGX™ Spark support to Docker Model Runner. The new NVIDIA DGX Spark delivers incredible performance, and Docker Model Runner makes it accessible. With Model Runner, you can easily run and iterate on larger models right on your local machine, using the same intuitive Docker experience you already trust. In this...

            How to Do Hardened Images (and Container Security) Right Container security is understandably a hot topic these days, with more and more workloads running atop this mainstay of the cloud native landscape. While I might be biased because I work at Docker, it is safe to say that containers are the dominant form factor for...

            AI coding assistants have evolved from simple autocomplete tools into full development partners. Yet even the best of them, like Claude Code, can’t act directly on your environment. Claude Code can suggest a database query, but can&#39;t run it. It can draft a GitHub issue, but can&#39;t create it. It can write a Slack message,...

            Fine-tuning a language model doesn’t have to be daunting. In our previous post on fine-tuning models with Docker Offload and Unsloth, we walked through how to train small, local models efficiently using Docker’s familiar workflows. This time, we’re narrowing the focus. Instead of asking a model to be good at everything, we can specialize it:...

            Running large language models (LLMs) on your local machine is one of the most exciting frontiers in AI development. At Docker, our goal is to make this process as simple and accessible as possible. That’s why we built Docker Model Runner, a tool to help you download and run LLMs with a single command. Until...
