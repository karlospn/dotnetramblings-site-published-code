            This post is a collaboration between Docker and Arm, demonstrating how Docker MCP Toolkit and the Arm MCP Server work together to simplify architecture migrations. Moving workloads from x86 to ARM64 architecture has become increasingly important. Organizations seek to reduce cloud costs and improve performance. AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, and Google Cloud Axion have made...

            Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a spec for exposing tools, models, or services to language models through a common interface. Think of them as smart adapters: they sit between a tool and the LLM, speaking a predictable protocol that lets the model interact with things like APIs, databases, and agents without needing to know...

            FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing...

            Hello, I’m Philippe, and I am a Principal Solutions Architect helping customers with their usage of Docker. I started getting seriously interested in generative AI about two years ago. What interests me most is the ability to run language models (LLMs) directly on my laptop (For work, I have a MacBook Pro M2 max, but...
