            In just a year, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to tools and external systems. The Docker MCP Catalog now hosts hundreds of containerized local MCP servers, enabling developers to quickly experiment and prototype locally. We have now added support for remote MCP servers to the Docker MCP...

            Generic DevSecOps advice may sound good on paper, but it often fails in practice because it ignores team context, workflow, and environment-specific needs.

Thinking back to MCP demos from six months ago, most developers were using one or two local MCP servers, each contributing just a handful of tools. Six months later and we have access to thousands...
