            AI is changing software development — but not how you think The hype is real, but so are the challenges. Here&#39;s what developers, teams, and tech leaders need to know about AI’s uneven, evolving role in software. Rumors of AI’s pervasiveness in software development have been greatly exaggerated. A look under the hood shows adoption...

            Security is a team sport: why everyone owns it now Six security takeaways from Docker’s 2025 State of Application Development Report. In the evolving world of software development, one thing is clear — security is no longer a siloed specialty. It’s a team sport, especially when vulnerabilities strike. That’s one of several key security findings...

            As AI development accelerates, developers need tools that let them move fast without having to reinvent their workflows. Docker Model Runner introduces a new specification for packaging large language models (LLMs) as OCI artifacts — a format developers already know and trust. It brings model sharing into the same workflows used for containers, with support...

            The last few years have made it clear that AI models will continue to be a fundamental component of many applications. The catch is that they’re also a fundamentally different type of component, with complex software and hardware requirements that don’t (yet) fit neatly into the constraints of container-oriented development lifecycles and architectures. To help...
