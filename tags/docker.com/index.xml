            AI-powered developer tools claim to boost your productivity, doing everything from intelligent auto-complete to (https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/). But the productivity gains users report have been something of a mixed bag. Some groups claim to get 3-5x (or more), productivity boosts, while other devs claim to get no benefit at all—or even losses of up to 19%. I...

            Docker Desktop now includes cagent bundled out of the box. This means developers can start building AI agents without a separate installation step. For those unfamiliar with cagent: it’s Docker’s open-source tool that lets you build AI agents using YAML configuration files instead of writing code. You define the agent’s behavior and tools, and cagent...

            This post is for Linux users running Docker Engine (Community Edition) directly on their hosts. Docker Desktop users don’t need to take any action — Engine updates are included automatically in future Desktop releases. Docker Engine v29 is a foundational release that sets the stage for the future of the Docker platform. While it may...

            In just a year, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to tools and external systems. The Docker MCP Catalog now hosts hundreds of containerized local MCP servers, enabling developers to quickly experiment and prototype locally. We have now added support for remote MCP servers to the Docker MCP...

      <title>Most DevSecOps Advice Is Useless without Context—Here’s What Actually Works</title>

            Generic DevSecOps advice may sound good on paper, but it often fails in practice because it ignores team context, workflow, and environment-specific needs. Overloaded controls, broad policies, and misapplied tools disrupt the flow of development. And once flow breaks, security measures are the first to get bypassed. The way forward isn&#39;t more rules but smarter...
