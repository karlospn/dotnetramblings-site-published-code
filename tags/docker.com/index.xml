            Running large AI models in the cloud gives access to immense capabilities, but it doesn’t come for free. The bigger the models, the bigger the bills, and with them, the risk of unexpected costs. Local models flip the equation. They safeguard privacy and keep costs predictable, but their smaller size often limits what you can...

            MCP is not an API. Tools are not agents. MCP is more than tools. Here’s what this means in practice. Most developers misread the Model Context Protocol because they map it onto familiar API mental models. That mistake breaks agent designs, observability, and the “last mile” where non-deterministic reasoning must meet deterministic execution. This piece...

            In the era of AI copilots and code generation tools productivity is skyrocketing, but so is the risk of insecure, untested, or messy code slipping into production. How do you ensure it doesn’t introduce vulnerabilities, bugs, or bad practices? A widely adopted tool to help address these concerns is SonarQube. It provides a rich set...

            In today’s fast-paced world of software development, product teams are expected to move quickly: building features, shipping updates, and reacting to user needs in real-time. But moving fast should never mean compromising on quality or security. Thanks to modern tooling, developers can now maintain high standards while accelerating delivery. In a previous article, we explored...
