            Last week, Docker was thrilled to be part of the inaugural AI Engineer Paris, a spectacular European debut that brought together an extraordinary lineup of speakers and companies. The conference, organized by the Koyeb team, made one thing clear: the days of simply sprinkling &#39;AI dust&#39; on applications are over. Meaningful results demand rigorous engineering,...

            We&#39;ve all been there: you&#39;re 90% of the way through downloading a massive, multi-gigabyte GGUF model file for llama.cpp when your internet connection hiccups. The download fails, and the progress bar resets to zero. It&#39;s a frustrating experience that wastes time, bandwidth, and momentum. Well, the llama.cpp community has just shipped a fantastic quality-of-life improvement...

            It’s 2 AM in a lab somewhere. A researcher has three terminals open, a half-written Jupyter notebook on one screen, an Excel sheet filled with sample IDs on another, and a half-eaten snack next to shell commands. They’re juggling scripts to run a protein folding model, parsing CSVs from the last experiment, searching for literature,...

            I&#39;ve been experimenting with local models for a while now, and the progress in making them accessible has been exciting. Initial experiences are often fantastic, many models, like Gemma 3 270M, are lightweight enough to run on common hardware. This potential for broad deployment is a major draw. However, as I&#39;ve tried to build meaningful,...

            Development teams are under growing pressure to secure their software supply chains. Teams need trusted images, streamlined deployments, and compliance-ready tooling from partners they can rely on long term. Our customers have made it clear that they’re not just looking for one-off vendors. They’re looking for true security partners across development and deployment. That’s why...

            Today, we want to highlight Docker MCP Toolkit, a free feature in Docker Desktop that gives you access to more than 200 MCP servers. It’s the easiest and most secure way to run MCP servers locally for your AI agents and workflows. The MCP toolkit allows you to isolate MCP servers in containers, securely configure...
