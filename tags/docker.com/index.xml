            CVEs dominated the conversation at Black Hat 2025. Across sessions, booth discussions, and hallway chatter, it was clear that teams are feeling the pressure to manage vulnerabilities at scale. While scanning remains an important tool, the focus is shifting toward removing security debt before it enters the software supply chain. Hardened images, compliance-ready tooling, and...

            This is Part 3 of our MCP Horror Stories series, where we examine real-world security incidents that validate the critical vulnerabilities threatening AI infrastructure and demonstrate how Docker MCP Toolkit provides enterprise-grade protection. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) promised to revolutionize how AI agents interact with developer tools, making GitHub repositories, Slack channels, and databases...

            What That Means for Devs and AI App Companies When GPT-5 dropped, OpenAI killed off a bunch of older APIs without much warning. A whole lot of apps face-planted overnight. If your app hard-codes itself to one provider, one API shape, or one model, this is the nightmare scenario. This is also different from losing...

            Building AI agents can be a complex task. But it also can be a fairly simple combination of answers to the following questions: What is the AI backend that powers my intelligent fuzzy computation? What tools do you need to give to the AI to access external systems or execute predefined software commands? What is...

            There’s a weird contradiction in modern AI development. We have better tools than ever. We’re building smarter systems with cleaner abstractions. And yet, every time you try to swap out a component in your stack, things fall apart. Again. This isn’t just an inconvenience. It’s become the norm. You’d think with all the frameworks and...

            A practical approach to escaping the expensive, slow world of API-dependent AI The $20K Monthly Reality Check You built a simple sentiment analyzer for customer reviews. It works great. Except it costs $847/month in API calls and takes 2.3 seconds to classify a single review. Your &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; document classifier burns through $3,200/month. Your chatbot feature?...

            Hi, I’m Philippe Charriere, a Principal Solutions Architect at Docker. I like to test new tools and see how they fit into real-world workflows. Recently, I set out to see if JetBrains&#39; Koog framework could run with Docker Model Runner, and what started as a quick test turned into something a lot more interesting than...
