            Hi, I’m Sergei Shitikov - a Docker Captain and Lead Software Engineer living in Berlin. I&#39;m focused on DevOps, developer experience, open source, and local AI tools. I created this extension to make it easier for anyone - even without a technical background - to get started with local LLMs using Docker Model Runner and...

            AI assistants are changing how we write code, but their true power is unleashed when they can interact with specialized, high-precision tools. OpenAI&#39;s Codex is a formidable coding partner, but what happens when you connect it directly to your running infrastructure? Enter the Docker MCP Toolkit. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolkit acts as a...

            jQuery is a household name among web developers who have been around the block. Initially released in 2006, it took the web development world by storm with its easy and intuitive syntax for navigating a document, selecting DOM elements, handling events, and making AJAX requests. At its peak in 2015, jQuery featured on 62.7 percent...

            Building Docker images is an important component of the software delivery pipeline for modern applications. It’s how we package our apps and services so that they can be distributed to others and deployed to production. While the Dockerfile has long been the standard for defining container images, it is known to be challenging to make...

            At Docker, we are building our hardened images to exacting standards. That means carefully crafting by hand, because humans are still the best security architects. That said, we understand the value of AI and deploy it as an extra set of eyes at critical junctures in our Docker Hardened Image (DHI) build process. With this...

            In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted development, most developers continue to struggle with clunky web interfaces, resource-intensive IDEs, and fragmented toolchains. But what if we told you there&#39;s a combination that pairs Google&#39;s 76.3K-star Gemini CLI (in just 5 months) with Docker&#39;s innovative MCP Toolkit, quietly revolutionizing how modern AI developers work? Enter the...

            Models are advancing quickly. GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini. Each release gives us more capabilities. But most real work isn’t solved by a single model. Developers are realizing they need a system of agents: different types of agents working together to accomplish more complex tasks. For example, a researcher to find information, a writer to summarize,...

            How to Do Hardened Images (and Container Security) Right Container security is understandably a hot topic these days, with more and more workloads running atop this mainstay of the cloud native landscape. While I might be biased because I work at Docker, it is safe to say that containers are the dominant form factor for...
