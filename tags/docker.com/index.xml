            Embeddings have become the backbone of many modern AI applications. From semantic search to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent recommendation systems, embedding models enable systems to understand the meaning behind text, code, or documents, not just the literal words. But generating embeddings comes with trade-offs. Using a hosted API for embedding generation often results in...

            Do you know who managed to cut costs by a staggering 90% by abandoning microservices for a monolith in May 2023? Not a cash-strapped startup or an indie project—Amazon itself, for its Prime Video service. The same AWS that earns billions every year by selling microservices infrastructure admitted that, sometimes, a good old monolith wins. ...

            Coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Kiro, and OpenCode are changing how developers work. But as these agents become more autonomous with capabilities like deleting repos, modifying files, and accessing secrets, developers face a real problem: how do you give agents enough access to be useful without adding unnecessary risk to your local...

            In today’s software-driven economy, securing software supply chains is no longer optional, it’s mission-critical. Yet enterprises often struggle to balance developer speed and security. According to theCUBE Research, 95% of organizations say Docker improved their ability to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, while 79% rate it highly effective at maintaining compliance with security standards. Docker embeds...
