            Docker experienced significant disruptions due to a widespread outage in AWS’s US-East-1 region on October 20, 2025. Developers worldwide rely on Docker as part of their daily workflow, and we regret the disruption this caused. In this post, we want to provide transparency about what happened, what we have learned, and how we are strengthening...

            I’m Mike Coleman, a staff solutions architect at Docker. In this role, I spend a lot of time talking to enterprise customers about AI adoption. One thing I hear over and over again is that these companies want to ensure appropriate guardrails are in place when it comes to deploying AI tooling. For instance, many...

            This is an abridged version of the interview we had in AI Guide to the Galaxy, where host Oleg Šelajev spoke with Jim Clark, Principal Software Engineer at Docker, to unpack Docker’s MCP Toolkit and MCP Gateway. TL;DR What they are: The MCP Toolkit helps you discover, run, and manage MCP servers; the MCP Gateway...

            Remember when owning software meant you bought a CD, installed it, and it was yours until your computer died? Even if you got a new computer, you could install that same software on the new one. Only “serious” software packages had strict licensing restrictions. These days, most of our tools live in the cloud, guarded...

            Trusted Software Starts Here The era of agents is here. Some teams are experimenting, others are just getting started, and a few are already running agents in production. But one challenge stands out: trust. Trust that your agents will act securely. Over 20 million developers already rely on Docker to build and ship software safely...

            Every developer eventually hits a wall with their local machine. Maybe it’s training an AI model that drains your CPU, compiling a massive codebase that makes your fan sound like a jet engine, or simply trying to run GPU workloads on a laptop that doesn’t have one. The result is the same: slow builds, limited...

That’s why we’re excited to announce a major upgrade to the interactive chat experience in Docker Model Runner, our tool for running AI workloads locally. We&#39;ve rolled out a...

            AI assistants are changing how we write code, but their true power is unleashed when they can interact with specialized, high-precision tools. OpenAI&#39;s Codex is a formidable coding partner, but what happens when you connect it directly to your running infrastructure? Enter the Docker MCP Toolkit. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolkit acts as a...

            jQuery is a household name among web developers who have been around the block. Initially released in 2006, it took the web development world by storm with its easy and intuitive syntax for navigating a document, selecting DOM elements, handling events, and making AJAX requests. At its peak in 2015, jQuery featured on 62.7 percent...
