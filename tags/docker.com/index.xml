            We launched Docker Hardened Images (DHI) in May, and in just two and a half months, adoption has accelerated rapidly across industries. From nimble startups to global enterprises, organizations are turning to DHI to achieve near-zero CVEs, shrink their attack surface, and harden their software supply chain, all without slowing down developers. In a short...

            Hardened container images and distroless software are the new hotness as startups and incumbents alike pile into the fast-growing market. In theory, hardened images provide not only a smaller attack surface but operational simplicity. In practice, there remains a fundamental – and often painful – tension between the promised security perfection of hardened images and...

            In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, integrating modern AI tools is essential to boosting productivity and enhancing the developer experience. One such advancement is the integration of Docker&#39;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolkit with Visual Studio Code’s GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. This powerful combination transforms how developers interact with containerized applications, enabling autonomous...

            When evaluating hardened image providers, don&#39;t just look for buzzwords like &amp;quot;zero-CVE&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;minimal.&amp;quot; True security in a dynamic environment demands a nuanced understanding of their process, their commitment, and their flexibility. For platform, DevOps, and SecOps teams, these are the critical questions that reveal whether a provider offers genuine security that enhances your workflow,...

            Generative AI (GenAI) and the models behind it have already reshaped how developers write code and build applications. But a new class of artificial intelligence is emerging: agentic AI. Unlike GenAI, which focuses on content generation, agentic systems can plan, reason, and take actions across multiple steps, enabling a new approach to building intelligent, goal-driven...
