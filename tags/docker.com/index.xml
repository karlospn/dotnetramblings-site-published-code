            Do you know who managed to cut costs by a staggering 90% by abandoning microservices for a monolith in May 2023? Not a cash-strapped startup or an indie project—Amazon itself, for its Prime Video service. The same AWS that earns billions every year by selling microservices infrastructure admitted that, sometimes, a good old monolith wins. ...

This CVE is a critical remote code execution vulnerability that scored 9.8 on the CVSS scale. While images from other hardened image vendors were still carrying the vulnerability, Docker’s security team and...

            Coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Kiro, and OpenCode are changing how developers work. But as these agents become more autonomous with capabilities like deleting repos, modifying files, and accessing secrets, developers face a real problem: how do you give agents enough access to be useful without adding unnecessary risk to your local...

            In today’s software-driven economy, securing software supply chains is no longer optional, it’s mission-critical. Yet enterprises often struggle to balance developer speed and security. According to theCUBE Research, 95% of organizations say Docker improved their ability to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, while 79% rate it highly effective at maintaining compliance with security standards. Docker embeds...

            On November 21, 2025, security researchers detected the beginning of what would become one of the most aggressive npm supply chain attacks to date. The Shai Hulud 2.0 campaign compromised over 25,000 GitHub repositories within 72 hours, targeting packages from major organizations including Zapier, ENS Domains, PostHog, and Postman. The malware&#39;s self-propagating design created a...

            On November 12-14, the Docker team was out in numbers at JFrog SwampUP Berlin 2025. We joined technical sessions, put on a fireside chat, and had conversations with attendees there. We’d like to thank the folks at JFrog for having us there and putting on such a great show! Here&#39;s our takeaways from the event about software...

            On November 19, 2025, the Golang project published two Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the widely-used golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package. While neither vulnerability received a critical CVSS score, both presented real risks to applications using SSH functionality in Go-based containers. CVE-2025-58181 affects SSH servers parsing GSSAPI authentication requests. The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger unbounded memory...

            When I started incorporating AI tools into my workflow, I was first frustrated. I didn&#39;t get the 5x or 10x gains others raved about on social. In fact, it slowed me down. But I persisted. Partly because I see it as my professional duty as a software engineer to be as productive as possible, partly...
