            Today, the Linux Foundation launched the Agentic AI Foundation with three founding projects: Anthropic&#39;s Model Context Protocol (MCP), Block&#39;s goose agent framework, and OpenAI&#39;s AGENTS.md standard. The foundation brings together the companies building the infrastructure layer for agents: Anthropic, Block, OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg, alongside key tooling and platform companies. Docker is...

            Docker has long been the simplest way to run containers. Developers start with a docker-compose.yml file, run docker compose up, and get things running fast. As teams grow and workloads expand into Kubernetes and integrate into cloud services, simplicity fades. Kubernetes has become the operating system of the cloud, but your clusters rarely live in...

            As agents become capable enough to write and refactor code, they should work natively inside the environments developers work in: editors. That’s why JetBrains and Zed are co-developing ACP, the Agent Client Protocol. ACP gives agents and editors a shared language, so any agent can read context, take actions, and respond intelligently without bespoke wiring...

            Trust is the most important consideration when you connect AI assistants to real tools. While MCP containerization provides strong isolation and limits the blast radius of malfunctioning or compromised servers, we’re continuously strengthening trust and security across the Docker MCP solutions to further reduce exposure to malicious code. As the MCP ecosystem scales from hundreds...

            For most developers, getting started with AI is still too complicated. Different models, tools, and platforms don’t always play nicely together. But with Docker, that’s changing fast. Docker is emerging as essential infrastructure for standardized, portable, and scalable AI environments. By bringing composability, simplicity, and GPU accessibility to the agentic era, Docker is helping developers...
