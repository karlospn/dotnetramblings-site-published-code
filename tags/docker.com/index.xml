            Hardened container images and distroless software are the new hotness as startups and incumbents alike pile into the fast-growing market. In theory, hardened images provide not only a smaller attack surface but operational simplicity. In practice, there remains a fundamental – and often painful – tension between the promised security perfection of hardened images and...

            In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, integrating modern AI tools is essential to boosting productivity and enhancing the developer experience. One such advancement is the integration of Docker&#39;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolkit with Visual Studio Code’s GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. This powerful combination transforms how developers interact with containerized applications, enabling autonomous...

            When evaluating hardened image providers, don&#39;t just look for buzzwords like &amp;quot;zero-CVE&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;minimal.&amp;quot; True security in a dynamic environment demands a nuanced understanding of their process, their commitment, and their flexibility. For platform, DevOps, and SecOps teams, these are the critical questions that reveal whether a provider offers genuine security that enhances your workflow,...

            Generative AI (GenAI) and the models behind it have already reshaped how developers write code and build applications. But a new class of artificial intelligence is emerging: agentic AI. Unlike GenAI, which focuses on content generation, agentic systems can plan, reason, and take actions across multiple steps, enabling a new approach to building intelligent, goal-driven...

            In our recent report, we describe that many enterprises today face a stark reality: despite years of digital transformation efforts, the majority of enterprise workloads—up to 80%—still run on legacy systems. This lag in modernization not only increases operational costs and security risks but also limits the agility needed to compete in a rapidly evolving...

            Docker Content Trust (DCT) was introduced 10 years ago as a way to verify the integrity and publisher of container images using The Update Framework (TUF) and the Notary v1 project. However, the upstream Notary codebase is no longer actively maintained and the ecosystem has since moved toward newer tools for image signing and verification....
