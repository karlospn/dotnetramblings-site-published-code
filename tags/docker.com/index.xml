            We use GenAI in every facet of technology now - internal knowledge bases, customer support systems, and code review bots, to name just a few use cases. And in nearly every one of these, someone eventually asks: What stops the model from returning something the user shouldn’t see?” This is a roadblock that companies building...

            AI-powered coding assistants are becoming a core part of modern development workflows. At the same time, many teams are increasingly concerned about where their code goes, how it’s processed, and who has access to it. By combining OpenCode with Docker Model Runner, you can build a powerful AI-assisted coding experience while keeping full control over...

            Why a “protected repo”? Modern teams depend on public container images, yet most environments lack a single, auditable control point for what gets pulled and when. This often leads to three operational challenges: Inconsistent or improvised base images that drift across teams and pipelines. Exposure to new CVEs when tags remain unchanged but upstream content...

            For more than a decade, the industry has tried to improve software security by pushing it closer to developers. We moved scanners into CI, added security checks to pull requests, and asked teams to respond faster to an ever-growing stream of vulnerabilities. And yet, the underlying problems have not gone away. The issue is not...
