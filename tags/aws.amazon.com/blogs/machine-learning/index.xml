            This post shows how to implement automated smoke testing using Amazon Nova Act headless mode in CI/CD pipelines. We use SauceDemo, a sample ecommerce application, as our target for demonstration. We demonstrate setting up Amazon Nova Act for headless browser automation in CI/CD environments and creating smoke tests that validate key user workflows. We then show how to implement parallel execution to maximize testing efficiency, configure GitLab CI/CD for automatic test execution on every deployment, and apply best practices for maintainable and scalable test automation.

            This post evaluates the reasoning capabilities of our latest offering in the Nova family, Amazon Nova Lite 2.0, using practical scenarios that test these critical dimensions. We compare its performance against other models in the Nova family—Lite 1.0, Micro, Pro 1.0, and Premier—to elucidate how the latest version advances reasoning quality and consistency.

            In this post, we show how to build chat agents in Amazon Quick Suite. We walk through a three-layer framework—identity, instructions, and knowledge—that transforms Quick Suite chat agents into intelligent enterprise AI assistants. In our example, we demonstrate how our chat agent guides feature discovery, use enterprise data to inform recommendations, and tailors solutions based on potential to impact and your team’s adoption readiness.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent insurance underwriting agent that addresses three critical challenges: unifying siloed data across CRM systems and databases, providing explainable and auditable AI decisions for regulatory compliance, and enabling automated fraud detection with consistent underwriting rules. The solution combines Amazon Nova 2 Lite for transparent risk assessment, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for managed MCP server infrastructure, and Amazon Quick Suite for natural language interactions—delivering a production-ready system that underwriters can deploy in under 30 minutes .
