            Ensemble models are becoming popular within the ML communities. They generate more accurate predictions through combining the predictions of multiple models. Pipelines can quickly be used to create and end-to-end ML pipeline for ensemble models. This enables developers to build highly accurate models while maintaining efficiency, and reproducibility. In this post, we provide an example of an ensemble model that was trained and deployed using Pipelines.

            In this post, we explore a solution for implementing load balancing across login nodes in Slurm-based HyperPod clusters. By distributing user activity evenly across all available nodes, this approach provides more consistent performance, better resource utilization, and a smoother experience for all users. We guide you through the setup process, providing practical steps to achieve effective load balancing in your HyperPod clusters.

            Bedrock multi-agent collaboration enables developers to build, deploy, and manage multiple specialized agents working together seamlessly to address increasingly complex business workflows. In this post, we show you how agentic workflows with Amazon Bedrock Agents can help accelerate this journey for research scientists with a natural language interface. We define an example analysis pipeline, specifically for lung cancer survival with clinical, genomics, and imaging modalities of biomarkers. We showcase a variety of specialized agents including a biomarker database analyst, statistician, clinical evidence researcher, and medical imaging expert in collaboration with a supervisor agent.
