            This post, developed through a strategic scientific partnership between AWS and the Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia Itaú (ICTi), P&amp;amp;D hub maintained by Itaú Unibanco, the largest private bank in Latin America, explores the technical aspects of sentiment analysis for both text and audio. We present experiments comparing multiple machine learning (ML) models and services, discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of each approach, and highlight how AWS services can be orchestrated to build robust, end-to-end solutions.

            This two-part series explores Flo Health&#39;s journey with generative AI for medical content verification. Part 1 examines our proof of concept (PoC), including the initial solution, capabilities, and early results. Part 2 covers focusing on scaling challenges and real-world implementation. Each article stands alone while collectively showing how AI transforms medical content management at scale.

            This post shows an automated PII detection and redaction solution using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails through a use case of processing text and image content in high volumes of incoming emails and attachments. The solution features a complete email processing workflow with a React-based user interface for authorized personnel to more securely manage and review redacted email communications and attachments. We walk through the step-by-step solution implementation procedures used to deploy this solution.

            Observe.ai developed the One Load Audit Framework (OLAF), which integrates with SageMaker to identify bottlenecks and performance issues in ML services, offering latency and throughput measurements under both static and dynamic data loads. In this blog post, you will learn how to use the OLAF utility to test and validate your SageMaker endpoint.
