            AI agents need to browse the web on your behalf. When your agent visits a website to gather information, complete a form, or verify data, it encounters the same defenses designed to stop unwanted bots: CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and outright blocks. Today, we are excited to share that AWS has a solution. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore […]

            In this post, we explore how to deploy NVIDIA&#39;s Parakeet ASR model on Amazon SageMaker AI using asynchronous inference endpoints to create a scalable, cost-effective pipeline for processing large volumes of audio data. The solution combines state-of-the-art speech recognition capabilities with AWS managed services like Lambda, S3, and Bedrock to automatically transcribe audio files and generate intelligent summaries, enabling organizations to unlock valuable insights from customer calls, meeting recordings, and other audio content at scale .

            In this post, we explore the critical design considerations for building responsible AI systems in healthcare and life sciences, focusing on establishing governance mechanisms, transparency artifacts, and security measures that ensure safe and effective generative AI applications. The discussion covers essential policies for mitigating risks like confabulation and bias while promoting trust, accountability, and patient safety throughout the AI development lifecycle.

            In this post, we explore the Five V&#39;s Framework—a field-tested methodology that has helped 65% of AWS Generative AI Innovation Center customer projects successfully transition from concept to production, with some launching in just 45 days. The framework provides a structured approach through Value, Visualize, Validate, Verify, and Venture phases, shifting focus from &amp;quot;What can AI do?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;What do we need AI to do?&amp;quot; while ensuring solutions deliver measurable business outcomes and sustainable operational excellence.
