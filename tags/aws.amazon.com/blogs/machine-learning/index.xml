            Underwriting is a fundamental function within the insurance industry, serving as the foundation for risk assessment and management. Underwriters are responsible for evaluating insurance applications, determining the level of risk associated with each applicant, and making decisions on whether to accept or reject the application based on the insurer’s guidelines and risk appetite. In this […]

            In this post, we demonstrate the process of fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B on SageMaker to specialize it in the generation of SQL queries (text-to-SQL). Meta Llama 3 8B is a relatively small model that offers a balance between performance and resource efficiency. AWS customers have explored fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B for the generation of SQL queries—especially when using non-standard SQL dialects—and have requested methods to import their customized models into Amazon Bedrock to benefit from the managed infrastructure and security that Amazon Bedrock provides when serving those models.

            As generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications become more prevalent, maintaining responsible AI principles becomes essential. Without proper safeguards, large language models (LLMs) can potentially generate harmful, biased, or inappropriate content, posing risks to individuals and organizations. Applying guardrails helps mitigate these risks by enforcing policies and guidelines that align with ethical principles and legal requirements. […]

            In the post, we introduce the AWS Neuron node problem detector and recovery DaemonSet for AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). This component can quickly detect rare occurrences of issues when Neuron devices fail by tailing monitoring logs. It marks the worker nodes in a defective Neuron device as unhealthy, and promptly replaces them with new worker nodes. By accelerating the speed of issue detection and remediation, it increases the reliability of your ML training and reduces the wasted time and cost due to hardware failure.
