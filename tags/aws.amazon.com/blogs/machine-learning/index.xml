            This post demonstrates how Amazon Bedrock, combined with a user feedback dataset and few-shot prompting, can refine responses for higher user satisfaction. By using Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2, we demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in response quality, making it a valuable tool for applications seeking accurate and personalized responses.

            In this post, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration pipeline for processing unstructured insurance data using Amazon Bedrock, featuring specialized agents for classification, conversion, and metadata extraction. We demonstrate how this domain-aware approach transforms diverse data formats like claims documents, videos, and audio files into metadata-rich outputs that enable fraud detection, customer 360-degree views, and advanced analytics.

            HERE collaborated with the GenAIIC. Our joint mission was to create an intelligent AI coding assistant that could provide explanations and executable code solutions in response to users’ natural language queries. The requirement was to build a scalable system that could translate natural language questions into HTML code with embedded JavaScript, ready for immediate rendering as an interactive map that users can see on screen.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a custom plugin with Amazon Q Business for backend integration. This plugin can integrate existing systems, including third-party systems, with little to no development in just weeks and automate critical workflows. Additionally, we show how to safeguard the solution using Amazon Cognito and AWS IAM Identity Center, maintaining the safety and integrity of sensitive data and workflows.
