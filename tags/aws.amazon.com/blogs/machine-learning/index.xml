            In this post, we guide you through the phases of customizing SLMs on AWS, with a specific focus on automotive terminology for diagnostics as a Q&amp;amp;A task. We begin with the data analysis phase and progress through the end-to-end process, covering fine-tuning, deployment, and evaluation. We compare a customized SLM with a general purpose LLM, using various metrics to assess vocabulary richness and overall accuracy.

            Bedrock agents can streamline workflows and provide AI automation to boost productivity. In this post, we show you how agentic workflows with Amazon Bedrock Agents can help accelerate this journey for research scientists with a natural language interface. We define an example analysis pipeline, specifically for lung cancer survival with clinical, genomics, and imaging modalities of biomarkers. We showcase a variety of tools including database retrieval with Text2SQL, statistical models and visual charts with scientific libraries, biomedical literature search with public APIs and internal evidence, and medical image processing with Amazon SageMaker jobs.

            Amazon Bedrock Guardrails helps implement safeguards for generative AI applications based on specific use cases and responsible AI policies. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails assists in controlling the interaction between users and foundation models (FMs) by detecting and filtering out undesirable and potentially harmful content, while maintaining safety and privacy. In this post, we explore a solution that automates building guardrails using a test-driven development approach.

            In this post, we show you how DXC and AWS collaborated to build an AI assistant using large language models (LLMs), enabling users to access and analyze different data types from a variety of data sources. The AI assistant is powered by an intelligent agent that routes user questions to specialized tools that are optimized for different data types such as text, tables, and domain-specific formats. It uses the LLMâ€™s ability to understand natural language, write code, and reason about conversational context.

            MSD, a leading pharmaceutical company, collaborates with AWS to implement a powerful text-to-SQL generative AI solution using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic&#39;s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. This approach streamlines data extraction from complex healthcare databases like DE-SynPUF, enabling analysts to generate SQL queries from natural language questions. The solution addresses challenges such as coded columns, non-intuitive names, and ambiguous queries, significantly reducing query time and democratizing data access.

            Cloud costs can significantly impact your business operations. Gaining real-time visibility into infrastructure expenses, usage patterns, and cost drivers is essential. To allocate costs to cloud resources, a tagging strategy is essential. This post outlines steps you can take to implement a comprehensive tagging governance strategy across accounts, using AWS tools and services that provide visibility and control. By setting up automated policy enforcement and checks, you can achieve cost optimization across your machine learning (ML) environment.

            In this post, we show you how to build a generative AI-powered trip-planning service that revolutionizes the way travelers discover and explore destinations. By using advanced AI technology and Amazon Location Service, the trip planner lets users translate inspiration into personalized travel itineraries. This innovative service goes beyond traditional trip planning methods, offering real-time interaction through a chat-based interface and maintaining scalability, reliability, and data security through AWS native services.

            Stability AIâ€™s newest launch of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5L) on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart enhances image generation, human anatomy rendering, and typography by producing more diverse outputs and adhering closely to user prompts, making it a significant upgrade over its predecessor. In this post, we explore advanced prompt engineering techniques that can enhance the performance of these models and facilitate the creation of compelling imagery through text-to-image transformations.

            You can now register machine learning (ML) models in Amazon SageMaker Model Registry with Amazon SageMaker Model Cards, making it straightforward to manage governance information for specific model versions directly in SageMaker Model Registry in just a few clicks. In this post, we discuss a new feature that supports the integration of model cards with the model registry. We discuss the solution architecture and best practices for managing model cards with a registered model version, and walk through how to set up, operationalize, and govern your models using the integration in the model registry.

            In this blog post, we demonstrate prompt engineering techniques to generate accurate and relevant analysis of tabular data using industry-specific language. This is done by providing large language models (LLMs) in-context sample data with features and labels in the prompt. The results are similar to fine-tuning LLMs without the complexities of fine-tuning models.
