            In this post, we describe how Aviva built a fully serverless MLOps platform based on the AWS Enterprise MLOps Framework and Amazon SageMaker to integrate DevOps best practices into the ML lifecycle. This solution establishes MLOps practices to standardize model development, streamline ML model deployment, and provide consistent monitoring.

            In this post, we show how the team at Schneider collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) to build a generative AI solution on Amazon Bedrock to solve this problem. The solution processes and evaluates each requests for proposal (RFP) and then routes high-value RFPs to the microgrid subject matter expert (SME) for approval and recommendation.
