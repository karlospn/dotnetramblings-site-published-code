            The introduction of Amazon Nova models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI, offering new opportunities for large language model (LLM) optimization. In this post, we demonstrate how to effectively perform model customization and RAG with Amazon Nova models as a baseline. We conducted a comprehensive comparison study between model customization and RAG using the latest Amazon Nova models, and share these valuable insights.

            Organizations are increasingly using multiple large language models (LLMs) when building generative AI applications. Although an individual LLM can be highly capable, it might not optimally address a wide range of use cases or meet diverse performance requirements. The multi-LLM approach enables organizations to effectively choose the right model for each task, adapt to different [â€¦]

            Prompt caching, now generally available on Amazon Bedrock with Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, along with Nova Micro, Nova Lite, and Nova Pro models, lowers response latency by up to 85% and reduces costs up to 90% by caching frequently used prompts across multiple API calls. This post provides a detailed overview of the prompt caching feature on Amazon Bedrock and offers guidance on how to effectively use this feature to achieve improved latency and cost savings.

            In this post, we introduce a state-of-the-art method to fine-tune LLMs by reinforcement learning, reviewed the pros and cons of RLHF vs. RLAIF vs. DPO, and saw how to scale LLM fine-tuning efforts with RLAIF. We also see how to implement an end-to-end RLAIF pipeline on SageMaker using the Hugging Face Transformer and TRL libraries, and using either off-the-shelf toxicity reward models to align responses during PPO or by directly prompting an LLM to generate quantitative reward feedback during PPO.
