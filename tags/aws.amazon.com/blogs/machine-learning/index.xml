            We demonstrate two methods for generating structured responses with Amazon Bedrock: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use with the Converse API. Prompt Engineering is flexible, works with Bedrock models (including those without Tool Use support), and handles various schema types (e.g., Open API schemas), making it a great starting point. Tool Use offers greater reliability, consistent results, seamless API integration, and runtime validation of JSON schema for enhanced control.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock Agents to solve complex business questions in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show how specialized agents in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), legal, and finance domains can work together to provide comprehensive business insights by analyzing data from multiple sources.

            In this post, we demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds.

            The EU AI Act establishes comprehensive regulations for AI development and deployment within the EU. AWS is committed to building trust in AI through various initiatives including being among the first signatories of the EU&#39;s AI Pact, providing AI Service Cards and guardrails, and offering educational resources while helping customers understand their responsibilities under the new regulatory framework.

            Starting July 14, 2025, the AWS DeepRacer Student Portal will enter a maintenance phase where new registrations will be disabled. Until September 15, 2025, existing users will retain full access to their content and training materials, with updates limited to critical security fixes, after which the portal will no longer be available.
