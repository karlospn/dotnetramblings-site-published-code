            AWS DeepComposer was first introduced during AWS re:Invent 2019 as a fun way for developers to compose music by using generative AI. AWS DeepComposer was the world’s first machine learning (ML)-enabled keyboard for developers to get hands-on—literally—with a musical keyboard and the latest ML techniques to compose their own music. After careful consideration, we have […]
