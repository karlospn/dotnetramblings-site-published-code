            In this post, we explore how to build a sophisticated voice-powered AWS operations assistant using Amazon Nova Sonic for speech processing and Strands Agents for multi-agent orchestration. This solution demonstrates how natural language voice interactions can transform cloud operations, making AWS services more accessible and operations more efficient.

            In this post, we&#39;ll show how Swisscom implemented Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build and scale their enterprise AI agents for customer support and sales operations. As an early adopter of Amazon Bedrock in the AWS Europe Region (Zurich), Swisscom leads in enterprise AI implementation with their Chatbot Builder system and various AI initiatives. Their successful deployments include Conversational AI powered by Rasa and fine-tuned LLMs on Amazon SageMaker, and the Swisscom Swisscom myAI assistant, built to meet Swiss data protection standards.

            Today we’re announcing Amazon SageMaker AI with MLflow, now including a serverless capability that dynamically manages infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and operations for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) development tasks. In this post, we explore how these new capabilities help you run large MLflow workloads—from generative AI agents to large language model (LLM) experimentation—with improved performance, automation, and security using SageMaker AI with MLflow.

            This post shows how to implement automated smoke testing using Amazon Nova Act headless mode in CI/CD pipelines. We use SauceDemo, a sample ecommerce application, as our target for demonstration. We demonstrate setting up Amazon Nova Act for headless browser automation in CI/CD environments and creating smoke tests that validate key user workflows. We then show how to implement parallel execution to maximize testing efficiency, configure GitLab CI/CD for automatic test execution on every deployment, and apply best practices for maintainable and scalable test automation.

            This post evaluates the reasoning capabilities of our latest offering in the Nova family, Amazon Nova Lite 2.0, using practical scenarios that test these critical dimensions. We compare its performance against other models in the Nova family—Lite 1.0, Micro, Pro 1.0, and Premier—to elucidate how the latest version advances reasoning quality and consistency.

            In this post, we show how to build chat agents in Amazon Quick Suite. We walk through a three-layer framework—identity, instructions, and knowledge—that transforms Quick Suite chat agents into intelligent enterprise AI assistants. In our example, we demonstrate how our chat agent guides feature discovery, use enterprise data to inform recommendations, and tailors solutions based on potential to impact and your team’s adoption readiness.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent insurance underwriting agent that addresses three critical challenges: unifying siloed data across CRM systems and databases, providing explainable and auditable AI decisions for regulatory compliance, and enabling automated fraud detection with consistent underwriting rules. The solution combines Amazon Nova 2 Lite for transparent risk assessment, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for managed MCP server infrastructure, and Amazon Quick Suite for natural language interactions—delivering a production-ready system that underwriters can deploy in under 30 minutes .
