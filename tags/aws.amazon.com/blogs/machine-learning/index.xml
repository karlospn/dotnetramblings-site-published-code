            The business team in Parcel Perform often needs access to data to answer questions related to merchants’ parcel deliveries, such as “Did we see a spike in delivery delays last week? If so, in which transit facilities were this observed, and what was the primary cause of the issue?” Previously, the data team had to manually form the query and run it to fetch the data. With the new generative AI-powered text-to-SQL capability in Parcel Perform, the business team can self-serve their data needs by using an AI assistant interface.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to use SageMaker Unified Studio and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to establish a robust permission framework for Amazon Bedrock models. We show how administrators can precisely manage which users and teams have access to specific models within a secure, collaborative environment. We guide you through creating granular permissions to control model access, with code examples for common enterprise governance scenarios.

            This post demonstrates how integrating an Amazon Bedrock streaming API with AWS AppSync subscriptions significantly enhances AI assistant responsiveness and user satisfaction. By implementing this streaming approach, the global financial services organization reduced initial response times for complex queries by approximately 75%—from 10 seconds to just 2–3 seconds—empowering users to view responses as they’re generated rather than waiting for complete answers.

            n this two-part series, we discuss a hub and spoke architecture pattern for building a multi-tenant and multi-account architecture. This pattern supports abstractions for shared services across use cases and teams, helping create secure, scalable, and reliable generative AI systems. In Part 1, we present a centralized hub for generative AI service abstractions and tenant-specific spokes, using AWS Transit Gateway for cross-account interoperability.

            INRIX pioneered the use of GPS data from connected vehicles for transportation intelligence. In this post, we partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer INRIX to demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock can be used to determine the best countermeasures for specific city locations using rich transportation data and how such countermeasures can be automatically visualized in street view images. This approach allows for significant planning acceleration compared to traditional approaches using conceptual drawings.

            Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems consume valuable resources by ingesting and maintaining embeddings for documents that might never be queried, resulting in unnecessary storage costs and reduced system efficiency. This post presents a just-in-time knowledge base solution that reduces unused consumption through intelligent document processing. The solution processes documents only when needed and automatically removes unused resources, so organizations can scale their document repositories without proportionally increasing infrastructure costs.
