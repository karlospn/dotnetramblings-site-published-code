            The rise of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). These powerful models, trained on vast amounts of data, can generate human-like text, answer questions, and even engage in creative writing tasks. However, training and deploying such models from scratch is […]

            AWS provides a powerful set of tools and services that simplify the process of building and deploying generative AI applications, even for those with limited experience in frontend and backend development. In this post, we explore a practical solution that uses Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive data applications, and AWS services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Cognito, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create a user-friendly generative AI application with authentication and deployment.

            In this post, we examine how to create business value through speech analytics with some examples focused on the following: 1) automatically summarizing, categorizing, and analyzing marketing content such as podcasts, recorded interviews, or videos, and creating new marketing materials based on those assets, 2) automatically extracting key points, summaries, and sentiment from a recorded meeting (such as an earnings call), and 3) transcribing and analyzing contact center calls to improve customer experience.

            Amazon Bedrock has launched a capability that organizations can use to tag on-demand models and monitor associated costs. Organizations can now label all Amazon Bedrock models with AWS cost allocation tags, aligning usage to specific organizational taxonomies such as cost centers, business units, and applications.

            In this post, we discuss how to use AWS to support a decentralized clinical trial across the four main pillars of a decentralized clinical trial (virtual trials, personalized patient engagement, patient-centric trial design, and centralized data management). By exploring these AWS powered alternatives, we aim to demonstrate how organizations can drive progress towards more environmentally friendly clinical research practices.

            This post introduces an innovative voice-based application workflow that harnesses the power of Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Transcribe, and React to systematically capture and document institutional knowledge through voice recordings from experienced staff members. Our solution uses Amazon Transcribe for real-time speech-to-text conversion, enabling accurate and immediate documentation of spoken knowledge. We then use generative AI, powered by Amazon Bedrock, to analyze and summarize the transcribed content, extracting key insights and generating comprehensive documentation.

            In this post, we showcase how to fine-tune a sentence transformer specifically for classifying an Amazon product into its product category (such as toys or sporting goods). We showcase two different sentence transformers, paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 and a proprietary Amazon large language model (LLM) called M5_ASIN_SMALL_V2.0, and compare their results.
