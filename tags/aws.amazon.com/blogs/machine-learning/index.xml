            In this post, we show how to create an automated continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline solution to build, scan, and deploy custom Docker images to SageMaker Studio domains. You can use this solution to promote consistency of the analytical environments for data science teams across your enterprise.

            In this post, we show you how to set up Amazon Lex for an omnichannel chatbot experience and Amazon Bedrock to be your secondary validation layer. This allows your customers to potentially provide out-of-band responses both at the intent and slot collection levels without having to be re-prompted, allowing for a seamless customer experience.

            Today, we’re excited to announce multi-turn conversation with an agent node (preview), a powerful new capability in Flows. This new capability enhances the agent node functionality, enabling dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue in a flow execution.

            In this post, we show you an innovative solution to a challenge faced by security teams in highly regulated industries: the efficient security analysis of vast amounts of video recordings from Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems. We demonstrate how you can use Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of models and Amazon Bedrock to perform the complex task of analyzing video recordings of server console sessions and perform queries to highlight any potential security anomalies.

            Accurately converting free text inputs into structured data is crucial for applications that involve data management and user interaction. In this post, we introduce a real business use case from Cato Networks that significantly improved user experience. By using Amazon Bedrock, we gained access to state-of-the-art generative language models with built-in support for JSON schemas and structured data.
