            Your multi-account strategy is the core of your foundational environment on AWS. Design decisions around your multi-account environment are critical for operating securely at scale. Grouping your workloads strategically into multiple AWS accounts enables you to apply different controls across workloads, track cost and usage, reduce the impact of account limits, and mitigate the complexity […]
