            In this post, we highlight how you can deploy multiple generative AI models in Amazon Bedrock to instruct an LLM model to create thematic summaries of text responses. We then show how to use multiple LLM models as a jury to review these LLM-generated summaries and assign a rating to judge the content alignment between the summary title and summary description.
