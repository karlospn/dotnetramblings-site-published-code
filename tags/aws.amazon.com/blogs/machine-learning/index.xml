            By leveraging the generative AI capabilities and tooling of Amazon Bedrock, you can create an intelligent nerve center that connects diverse data sources, converts data into actionable insights, and creates a comprehensive plan to mitigate supply chain risks. This post walks through how Amazon Bedrock Flows connects your business systems, monitors medical device shortages, and provides mitigation strategies based on knowledge from Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases or data stored in Amazon S3 directly.

            In this post, we discuss how FMs can reliably automate the classification of insurance service emails through prompt engineering. When formulating the problem as a classification task, an FM can perform well enough for production environments, while maintaining extensibility into other tasks and getting up and running quickly. All experiments were conducted using Anthropic’s Claude models on Amazon Bedrock.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to use H-optimus-0 for two common digital pathology tasks: patch-level analysis for detailed tissue examination, and slide-level analysis for broader diagnostic assessment. Through practical examples, we show you how to adapt this FM to these specific use cases while optimizing computational resources.

            The AWS Social Responsibility &amp;amp; Impact (SRI) team recognized an opportunity to augment this function using generative AI. The team developed an innovative solution to streamline grant proposal review and evaluation by using the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of Amazon Bedrock. In this post, we explore the technical implementation details and key learnings from the team’s Amazon Bedrock powered grant proposal review solution, providing a blueprint for organizations seeking to optimize their grants management processes.

            In this post, we review how Aetion’s Smart Subgroups Interpreter enables users to interact with Smart Subgroups using natural language queries. Powered by Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude 3 large language models (LLMs), the interpreter responds to user questions expressed in conversational language about patient subgroups and provides insights to generate further hypotheses and evidence.

            As generative AI adoption grows, organizations should establish a generative AI operating model. An operating model defines the organizational design, core processes, technologies, roles and responsibilities, governance structures, and financial models that drive a business’s operations. In this post, we evaluate different generative AI operating model architectures that could be adopted.
