            Organizations often offer support in multiple languages, saying “contact us for translations.” However, customers who don’t speak the predominant language often don’t know that translations are available or how to request them. This can lead to poor customer experience and lost business. A better approach is proactively providing information in multiple languages so customers can […]

            In the fast-paced world of customer service, efficiency and accuracy are paramount. After each call, contact center agents often spend up to a third of the total call time summarizing the customer conversation. Additionally, manual summarization can lead to inconsistencies in the style and level of detail due to varying interpretations of note-taking guidelines. This […]
