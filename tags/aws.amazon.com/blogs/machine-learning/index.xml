            In this post, we explore a generative AI solution leveraging Amazon Bedrock to streamline the WAFR process. We demonstrate how to harness the power of LLMs to build an intelligent, scalable system that analyzes architecture documents and generates insightful recommendations based on AWS Well-Architected best practices. This solution automates portions of the WAFR report creation, helping solutions architects improve the efficiency and thoroughness of architectural assessments while supporting their decision-making process.

            Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases has a metadata filtering capability that allows you to refine search results based on specific attributes of the documents, improving retrieval accuracy and the relevance of responses. These metadata filters can be used in combination with the typical semantic (or hybrid) similarity search. In this post, we discuss using metadata filters with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

            In this two-part series, we discuss how you can reduce the DeepSeek model customization complexity by using the pre-built fine-tuning workflows (also called “recipes”) for both DeepSeek-R1 model and its distilled variations, released as part of Amazon SageMaker HyperPod recipes. In this first post, we will build a solution architecture for fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and demonstrate the approach by providing a step-by-step example on customizing the DeepSeek-R1 Distill Qwen 7b model using recipes, achieving an average of 25% on all the Rouge scores, with a maximum of 49% on Rouge 2 score with both SageMaker HyperPod and SageMaker training jobs.

            This guide demonstrates how to deploy an open source foundation model from Hugging Face on Amazon EC2 instances across three locations: a commercial AWS Region and two AWS Local Zones. Through comparative benchmarking tests, we illustrate how deploying foundation models in Local Zones closer to end users can significantly reduce latency—a critical factor for real-time applications such as conversational AI assistants.

            The AWS DeepRacer League is the world&#39;s first global autonomous racing league powered by machine learning (ML). Over the past 6 years, a diverse community of over 560,000 builders from more than 150 countries worldwide have participated in the League to learn ML fundamentals hands-on through the fun of friendly autonomous racing. After an 8-month season of nail-biting virtual qualifiers, finalists convened in person at re:Invent in Las Vegas for one final showdown to compete for prizes and glory in the high-stakes, winner-take-all AWS DeepRacer League Championship.

            In AWS DeepRacer: How to master physical racing?, I wrote in detail about some aspects relevant to racing AWS DeepRacer in the physical world. The previous post was left open-ended—with one last Championship Final left, it was too early to share all my secrets. Now that AWS re:Invent is over, it’s time to share my strategy, how I prepared, and how it went in the end.
