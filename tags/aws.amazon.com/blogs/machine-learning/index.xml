            With a one-click installation of the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) add-on for SageMaker HyperPod observability, you can consolidate health and performance data from NVIDIA DCGM, instance-level Kubernetes node exporters, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), integrated file systems, Kubernetes APIs, Kueue, and SageMaker HyperPod task operators. In this post, we walk you through installing and using the unified dashboards of the out-of-the-box observability feature in SageMaker HyperPod. We cover the one-click installation from the Amazon SageMaker AI console, navigating the dashboard and metrics it consolidates, and advanced topics such as setting up custom alerts.

            mazon Nova Sonic is now integrated with LiveKit’s WebRTC framework, a widely used platform that enables developers to build real-time audio, video, and data communication applications. This integration makes it possible for developers to build conversational voice interfaces without needing to manage complex audio pipelines or signaling protocols. In this post, we explain how this integration works, how it addresses the historical challenges of voice-first applications, and some initial steps to start using this solution.

      <description>
        
          
            The business team in Parcel Perform often needs access to data to answer questions related to merchants’ parcel deliveries, such as “Did we see a spike in delivery delays last week? If so, in which transit facilities were this observed, and what was the primary cause of the issue?” Previously, the data team had to manually form the query and run it to fetch the data. With the new generative AI-powered text-to-SQL capability in Parcel Perform, the business team can self-serve their data needs by using an AI assistant interface.

            This post demonstrates how integrating an Amazon Bedrock streaming API with AWS AppSync subscriptions significantly enhances AI assistant responsiveness and user satisfaction. By implementing this streaming approach, the global financial services organization reduced initial response times for complex queries by approximately 75%—from 10 seconds to just 2–3 seconds—empowering users to view responses as they’re generated rather than waiting for complete answers.

            n this two-part series, we discuss a hub and spoke architecture pattern for building a multi-tenant and multi-account architecture. This pattern supports abstractions for shared services across use cases and teams, helping create secure, scalable, and reliable generative AI systems. In Part 1, we present a centralized hub for generative AI service abstractions and tenant-specific spokes, using AWS Transit Gateway for cross-account interoperability.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to use the evaluation features of Amazon Bedrock to deliver reliable results across language barriers without the need for localized prompts or custom infrastructure. Through comprehensive testing and analysis, we share practical strategies to help reduce the cost and complexity of multilingual evaluation while maintaining high standards across global large language model (LLM) deployments.

            The Cohere Embed 4 multimodal embeddings model is now generally available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. The Embed 4 model is built for multimodal business documents, has leading multilingual capabilities, and offers notable improvement over Embed 3 across key benchmarks. In this post, we discuss the benefits and capabilities of this new model. We also walk you through how to deploy and use the Embed 4 model using SageMaker JumpStart.

            INRIX pioneered the use of GPS data from connected vehicles for transportation intelligence. In this post, we partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer INRIX to demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock can be used to determine the best countermeasures for specific city locations using rich transportation data and how such countermeasures can be automatically visualized in street view images. This approach allows for significant planning acceleration compared to traditional approaches using conceptual drawings.

            Today, we are excited to announce that Qwen3, the latest generation of large language models (LLMs) in the Qwen family, is available through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. With this launch, you can deploy the Qwen3 models—available in 0.6B, 4B, 8B, and 32B parameter sizes—to build, experiment, and responsibly scale your generative AI applications on AWS. In this post, we demonstrate how to get started with Qwen3 on Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and SageMaker JumpStart.

            Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems consume valuable resources by ingesting and maintaining embeddings for documents that might never be queried, resulting in unnecessary storage costs and reduced system efficiency. This post presents a just-in-time knowledge base solution that reduces unused consumption through intelligent document processing. The solution processes documents only when needed and automatically removes unused resources, so organizations can scale their document repositories without proportionally increasing infrastructure costs.

            In this post, we show how to build a fully deployable solution that processes video streams using OpenCV, Amazon Bedrock for contextual scene understanding and automated responses through Amazon Bedrock Agents. This solution extends the capabilities demonstrated in Automate chatbot for document and data retrieval using Amazon Bedrock Agents and Knowledge Bases, which discussed using Amazon Bedrock Agents for document and data retrieval. In this post, we apply Amazon Bedrock Agents to real-time video analysis and event monitoring.

            In this post, we guide you through the stages of customizing large language models (LLMs) with SageMaker Unified Studio and SageMaker AI, covering the end-to-end process starting from data discovery to fine-tuning FMs with SageMaker AI distributed training, tracking metrics using MLflow, and then deploying models using SageMaker AI inference for real-time inference. We also discuss best practices to choose the right instance size and share some debugging best practices while working with JupyterLab notebooks in SageMaker Unified Studio.
