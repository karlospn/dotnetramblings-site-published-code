            To better protect themselves, many cyclists are starting to ride with cameras mounted to the front or back of their bicycle. In this blog post, I will demonstrate a machine learning solution that cyclists can use to better identify close calls. The architecture of the solution uses Amazon Rekognition to detect vehicles in recorded bike ride videos. It then analyzes the video to determine if any vehicles are passing too close to the cyclist, within the 3-foot safe distance required by law.

            In this post, we explore what language embeddings are and how they can be used to enhance your application. We show how, by using the properties of embeddings, we can implement a real-time zero-shot classifier and can add powerful features such as semantic search.

            Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used.

            In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a knowledge base solution by integrating enterprise data with Amazon Q Business using Amazon S3. This approach helps organizations improve operational efficiency, reduce response times, and gain valuable insights from their historical data. The solution uses AWS security best practices to promote data protection while enabling teams to create a comprehensive knowledge base from various data sources.
