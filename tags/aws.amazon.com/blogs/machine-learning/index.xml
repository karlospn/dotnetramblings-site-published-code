            In this post, we show how to extend Amazon Bedrock Agents to hybrid and edge services such as AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones to build distributed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with on-premises data for improved model outcomes. With Outposts, we also cover a reference pattern for a fully local RAG application that requires both the foundation model (FM) and data sources to reside on premises.

            The research team at AWS has worked extensively on building and evaluating the multi-agent collaboration (MAC) framework so customers can orchestrate multiple AI agents on Amazon Bedrock Agents. In this post, we explore the concept of multi-agent collaboration (MAC) and its benefits, as well as the key components of our MAC framework. We also go deeper into our evaluation methodology and present insights from our studies.

            The Education and Training Quality Authority (BQA) plays a critical role in improving the quality of education and training services in the Kingdom Bahrain. BQA reviews the performance of all education and training institutions, including schools, universities, and vocational institutes, thereby promoting the professional advancement of the nation’s human capital. In this post, we explore how BQA used the power of Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, and other AWS services to streamline the overall reporting workflow.
