            In this post, we discuss existing prompt-level threats and outline several security guardrails for mitigating prompt-level threats. For our example, we work with Anthropic Claude on Amazon Bedrock, implementing prompt templates that allow us to enforce guardrails against common security threats such as prompt injection. These templates are compatible with and can be modified for other LLMs.

            Through this series of posts, we share our generative AI journey and use cases, detailing the architecture, AWS services used, lessons learned, and the impact of these solutions on our teams and customers. In this first post, we explore Account Summaries, one of our initial production use cases built on Amazon Bedrock. Account Summaries equips our teams to be better prepared for customer engagements. It combines information from various sources into comprehensive, on-demand summaries available in our CRM or proactively delivered based on upcoming meetings.

            Amazon Q Business is a conversational assistant powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that enhances workforce productivity by answering questions and completing tasks based on information in your enterprise systems, which each user is authorized to access. In an earlier post, we discussed how you can build private and secure enterprise generative AI applications with Amazon Q Business and AWS IAM Identity Center. If you want to use Amazon Q Business to build enterprise generative AI applications, and have yet to adopt organization-wide use of AWS IAM Identity Center, you can use Amazon Q Business IAM Federation to directly manage user access to Amazon Q Business applications from your enterprise identity provider (IdP), such as Okta or Ping Identity.

            This post explores an innovative application of large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of customer review analysis. LLMs are a type of foundation model (FM) that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This post discusses how LLMs can be accessed through Amazon Bedrock to build a generative AI solution that automatically summarizes key information, recognizes the customer sentiment, and generates actionable insights from customer reviews. This method shows significant promise in saving human analysts time while producing high-quality results.

            Today, physicians spend about 49% of their workday documenting clinical visits, which impacts physician productivity and patient care. Did you know that for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR? As a consequence, healthcare practitioners exhibit a pronounced inclination towards conversational intelligence solutions, [â€¦]

            While presigned URLs offer a convenient way to grant temporary access to S3 objects, sharing these URLs with people outside of the workteam can lead to unintended access of those objects. To mitigate this risk and enhance the security of SageMaker Ground Truth labeling tasks, we have introduced a new feature that adds an additional layer of security by restricting access to the presigned URLs to the workerâ€™s IP address or virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint from which they access the labeling task.

Amazon Q Business can create SQL queries to your data sources when provided with the database schema, additional metadata describing the columns and tables, and prompting instructions. You can extend this architecture to use additional data sources, query validation, and prompting techniques to cover a wider range of use cases.
