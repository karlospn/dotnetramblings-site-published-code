            In this post, we take an animated short film, Picchu, produced by FuzzyPixel from Amazon Web Services (AWS), prepare training data by extracting key character frames, and fine-tune a character-consistent model for the main character Mayu and her mother, so we can quickly generate storyboard concepts for new sequels like the following images.

            The art of storyboarding stands as the cornerstone of modern content creation, weaving its essential role through filmmaking, animation, advertising, and UX design. Though traditionally, creators have relied on hand-drawn sequential illustrations to map their narratives, today’s AI foundation models (FMs) are transforming this landscape. FMs like Amazon Nova Canvas and Amazon Nova Reel offer […]

      <description>
        
          
            In this post, we explore how natural language database analytics can revolutionize the way organizations interact with their structured data through the power of large language model (LLM) agents. Natural language interfaces to databases have long been a goal in data management. Agents enhance database analytics by breaking down complex queries into explicit, verifiable reasoning steps and enabling self-correction through validation loops that can catch errors, analyze failures, and refine queries until they accurately match user intent and schema requirements.

            In this blog post, we demonstrate an end-to-end approach for building and evaluating a KIE solution using Amazon Nova models available through Amazon Bedrock. This end-to-end approach encompasses three critical phases: data readiness (understanding and preparing your documents), solution development (implementing extraction logic with appropriate models), and performance measurement (evaluating accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness). We illustrate this comprehensive approach using the FATURA dataset—a collection of diverse invoice documents that serves as a representative proxy for real-world enterprise data.

            This post describes the agentic AI assistant built by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and the GenAIIC to respond to citizens’ questions about government procedures. The solution consists of two primary components: an input guardrail system that helps prevent the system from responding to harmful user queries and a government procedures agent that retrieves relevant information and generates responses.

            In this post, we provide a data imputation solution using Amazon SageMaker AI, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions. This solution is designed for environmental analysts, public health officials, and business intelligence professionals who need reliable PM2.5 data for trend analysis, reporting, and decision-making. We sourced our sample training dataset from openAFRICA. Our solution predicts PM2.5 values using time-series forecasting.
