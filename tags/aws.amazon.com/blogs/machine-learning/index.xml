            Organizations across industries want to categorize and extract insights from high volumes of documents of different formats. Manually processing these documents to classify and extract information remains expensive, error prone, and difficult to scale. Advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have given rise to intelligent document processing (IDP) solutions that can automate the document classification, […]

            With Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant, context-specific, and accurate responses without retraining the FMs. In this post, we discuss two new features of Knowledge Bases for […]
