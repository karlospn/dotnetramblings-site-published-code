            Machine learning operations (MLOps) is the combination of people, processes, and technology to productionize ML use cases efficiently. To achieve this, enterprise customers must develop MLOps platforms to support reproducibility, robustness, and end-to-end observability of the ML use case’s lifecycle. Those platforms are based on a multi-account setup by adopting strict security constraints, development best […]

            In this post, we demonstrated how a financial services company can use an FM to process large volumes of customer records and get specific data-driven product recommendations. We also showed how to implement an automated monitoring solution for Amazon Bedrock batch inference jobs. By using EventBridge, Lambda, and DynamoDB, you can gain real-time visibility into batch processing operations, so you can efficiently generate personalized product recommendations based on customer credit data.
