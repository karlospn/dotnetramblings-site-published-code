            In this post, we explain how we overcame the limitations of single-agent AI systems through a human-centric approach, implemented structured outputs to significantly reduce hallucinations and built a scalable solution now positioned for expansion across the AMET QA team and later across other QA teams in International Emerging Stores and Payments (IESP) Org.

            In this post, we describe how you can use Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings to retrieve specific video segments. We also review a real-world use case in which Nova Multimodal Embeddings achieved a recall success rate of 96.7% and a high-precision recall of 73.3% (returning the target content in the top two results) when tested against a library of 170 gaming creative assets. The model also demonstrates strong cross-language capabilities with minimal performance degradation across multiple languages.

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings addresses the challenges of crossmodal search through a practical ecommerce use case. We examine the technical limitations of traditional approaches and demonstrate how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings enables retrieval across text, images, and other modalities. You learn how to implement a crossmodal search system by generating embeddings, handling queries, and measuring performance. We provide working code examples and share how to add these capabilities to your applications.

            Quantized models can be seamlessly deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI using a few lines of code. In this post, we explore why quantization matters—how it enables lower-cost inference, supports deployment on resource-constrained hardware, and reduces both the financial and environmental impact of modern LLMs, while preserving most of their original performance. We also take a deep dive into the principles behind PTQ and demonstrate how to quantize the model of your choice and deploy it on Amazon SageMaker.

            This post, developed through a strategic scientific partnership between AWS and the Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia Itaú (ICTi), P&amp;amp;D hub maintained by Itaú Unibanco, the largest private bank in Latin America, explores the technical aspects of sentiment analysis for both text and audio. We present experiments comparing multiple machine learning (ML) models and services, discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of each approach, and highlight how AWS services can be orchestrated to build robust, end-to-end solutions.
