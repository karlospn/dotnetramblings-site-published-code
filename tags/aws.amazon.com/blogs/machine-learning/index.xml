            In this post, we will explore building a reusable RAG data pipeline on LangChain—an open source framework for building applications based on LLMs—and integrating it with AWS Glue and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. The end solution is a reference architecture for scalable RAG indexing and deployment.

            In this post, we cover the core concepts behind RAG architectures and discuss strategies for evaluating RAG performance, both quantitatively through metrics and qualitatively by analyzing individual outputs. We outline several practical tips for improving text retrieval, including using hybrid search techniques, enhancing context through data preprocessing, and rewriting queries for better relevance.

            Agentic workflows are a fresh new perspective in building dynamic and complex business use- case based workflows with the help of large language models (LLM) as their reasoning engine or brain. In this post, we set up an agent using Amazon Bedrock Agents to act as a software application builder assistant.

            After careful consideration, we made the decision to discontinue Rekognition people pathing on October 31, 2025. New customers will not be able to access the capability effective October 24, 2024, but existing customers will be able to use the capability as normal until October 31, 2025. This post discusses an alternative solution to Rekognition people pathing and how you can implement this solution in your applications.
