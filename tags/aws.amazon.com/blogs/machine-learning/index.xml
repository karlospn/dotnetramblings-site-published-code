      <title>Introducing structured output for Custom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock</title>

            Today, we are excited to announce the addition of structured output to Custom Model Import. Structured output constrains a model&#39;s generation process in real time so that every token it produces conforms to a schema you define. Rather than relying on prompt-engineering tricks or brittle post-processing scripts, you can now generate structured outputs directly at inference time.

      <title>Transform your MCP architecture: Unite MCP servers through AgentCore Gateway</title>

            Earlier this year, we introduced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, a fully managed service that serves as a centralized MCP tool server, providing a unified interface where agents can discover, access, and invoke tools. Today, we&#39;re extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational complexity of maintaining separate gateways, while providing the same centralized tool and authentication management that existed for REST APIs and AWS Lambda functions.

            In this post, we show you how Amazon Search optimized GPU instance utilization by leveraging AWS Batch for SageMaker Training jobs. This managed solution enabled us to orchestrate machine learning (ML) training workloads on GPU-accelerated instance families like P5, P4, and others. We will also provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the use case implementation.

            Enterprises in regulated industries often need mathematical certainty that every AI response complies with established policies and domain knowledge. Regulated industries can’t use traditional quality assurance methods that test only a statistical sample of AI outputs and make probabilistic assertions about compliance. When we launched Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in preview at […]
