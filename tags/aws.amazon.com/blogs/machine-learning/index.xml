            Every year, AWS Sales personnel draft in-depth, forward looking strategy documents for established AWS customers. These documents help the AWS Sales team to align with our customer growth strategy and to collaborate with the entire sales team on long-term growth ideas for AWS customers. In this post, we showcase how the AWS Sales product team built the generative AI account plans draft assistant.

            Inspecting wind turbines, power lines, 5G towers, and pipelines is a tough job. It’s often dangerous, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This post is the first in a three-part series exploring AI Workforce, the AWS AI-powered drone inspection system. In this post, we introduce the concept and key benefits. The second post dives into the AWS architecture that powers AI Workforce, and the third focuses on the drone setup and integration.

            This post explores the application of LLMs in executing complex analytical queries through an API, with specific focus on Amazon Bedrock. To demonstrate this process, we present a use case where the system identifies the patient with the least number of vaccines by retrieving, grouping, and sorting data, and ultimately presenting the final result.
