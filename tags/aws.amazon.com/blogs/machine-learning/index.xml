            Amazon SageMaker HyperPod clusters with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) orchestration now support creating and managing interactive development environments such as JupyterLab and open source Visual Studio Code, streamlining the ML development lifecycle by providing managed environments for familiar tools to data scientists. This post shows how HyperPod administrators can configure Spaces for their clusters, and how data scientists can create and connect to these Spaces.

            RoboTic-Tac-Toe is an interactive game where two physical robots move around a tic-tac-toe board, with both the gameplay and robots’ movements orchestrated by LLMs. Players can control the robots using natural language commands, directing them to place their markers on the game board. In this post, we explore the architecture and prompt engineering techniques used to reason about a tic-tac-toe game and decide the next best game strategy and movement plan for the current player.
