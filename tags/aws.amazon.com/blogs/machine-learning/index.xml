            In this post, we demonstrate how to use large vision models (LVMs) for semantic video search using natural language and image queries. We introduce some use case-specific methods, such as temporal frame smoothing and clustering, to enhance the video search performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the end-to-end functionality of this approach by using both asynchronous and real-time hosting options on Amazon SageMaker AI to perform video, image, and text processing using publicly available LVMs on the Hugging Face Model Hub.
