            In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings addresses the challenges of crossmodal search through a practical ecommerce use case. We examine the technical limitations of traditional approaches and demonstrate how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings enables retrieval across text, images, and other modalities. You learn how to implement a crossmodal search system by generating embeddings, handling queries, and measuring performance. We provide working code examples and share how to add these capabilities to your applications.

            Quantized models can be seamlessly deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI using a few lines of code. In this post, we explore why quantization matters—how it enables lower-cost inference, supports deployment on resource-constrained hardware, and reduces both the financial and environmental impact of modern LLMs, while preserving most of their original performance. We also take a deep dive into the principles behind PTQ and demonstrate how to quantize the model of your choice and deploy it on Amazon SageMaker.

            This post, developed through a strategic scientific partnership between AWS and the Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia Itaú (ICTi), P&amp;amp;D hub maintained by Itaú Unibanco, the largest private bank in Latin America, explores the technical aspects of sentiment analysis for both text and audio. We present experiments comparing multiple machine learning (ML) models and services, discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of each approach, and highlight how AWS services can be orchestrated to build robust, end-to-end solutions.

            This post shows an automated PII detection and redaction solution using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails through a use case of processing text and image content in high volumes of incoming emails and attachments. The solution features a complete email processing workflow with a React-based user interface for authorized personnel to more securely manage and review redacted email communications and attachments. We walk through the step-by-step solution implementation procedures used to deploy this solution.
