            Developing robust text-to-SQL capabilities is a critical challenge in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and database management. The complexity of NLP and database management increases in this field, particularly while dealing with complex queries and database structures. In this post, we introduce a straightforward but powerful solution with accompanying code to text-to-SQL using a custom agent implementation along with Amazon Bedrock and Converse API.
