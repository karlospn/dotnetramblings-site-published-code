            In real-world video and image analysis, businesses often face the challenge of detecting objects that weren’t part of a model’s original training set. This becomes especially difficult in dynamic environments where new, unknown, or user-defined objects frequently appear. In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Data Automation uses OSOD to enhance video understanding.

            AWS announced managed tiered checkpointing in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a purpose-built infrastructure to scale and accelerate generative AI model development across thousands of AI accelerators. Managed tiered checkpointing uses CPU memory for high-performance checkpoint storage with automatic data replication across adjacent compute nodes for enhanced reliability. In this post, we dive deep into those concepts and understand how to use the managed tiered checkpointing feature.
