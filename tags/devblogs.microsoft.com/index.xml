Exceeding this limit can have significant cost and performance implications. Therefore, it is essential to manage the size of the input sent to the LLM, particularly when using chat completion models. […]

            A lesson about the software forensics process involved in developing the Bring Back Plus/Minus extension, which brings back the plus/minus symbols to the editor outlining feature in Visual Studio 2022. While I did have the advantage of being able to look at the Visual Studio source code, I could have figured this out just as well without […]
