They tried Get­Caret­Pos, but it always failed. Most window manager state functions that were global in 16-bit Windows became per-thread in 32-bit Windows, as part of the con

            Supporting re‑ranking has been one of the most common requests lately. While not always essential, it can be a valuable addition to a solution when you want to improve the precision of your results. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal, standardized API for a “re‑rank” call across providers, so the most reliable approach today is t

            Last time, we noted that the std::rotate function requires only forward iterators. The algorithm we explored last time involved a clever sequence of reversals, but reversals require bidirectional iterators (one to iterator forward from the beginning and another to iterate backward from the end).

            Suppose you have a large block of memory, and you want to swap two blocks that reside inside that large block. For concreteness, say you have a block of memory of the form A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, E1, and you want to swap the B&#39;s and D&#39;s, producing A1, A2, D1, D2, D3, C1, C2, B1, B2, E1.
