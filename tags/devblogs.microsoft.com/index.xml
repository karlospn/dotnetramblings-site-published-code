            2025 was a big year for .NET developers. We kicked things off with early .NET 10 previews, kept momentum with steady tooling and runtime improvements, and wrapped it all up with the launch of .NET 10 in November. 🚀 .NET 10 .NET 10 was the headline event of the year: the latest Long Term Support (L

            A customer wanted to write a process that could detect that it is nearing its job memory limit. Now, if you were asking about system memory limits rather than job memory limits, you would use the Create­Memory­Resource­Notification to create a &amp;quot;low memory&amp;quot; notification. As noted in the documentation, this notificatio

            Commenter Shawn wondered why we are so worried about memory access semantics. Back in my day, we just used full barriers everywhere, and I didn&#39;t hear nobody complainin&#39;.

            Just to see what happens, a customer called Set­ClipboardData(CF_TEXT) and passed a memory block that was intentionally not null-terminated. They found that when they subsequently pasted the string (say, into Notepad), the last character didn&#39;t get pasted. As a second experiment, they over-allocated the buffer b

            A customer didn&#39;t understand why their Win32 accelerator key for Ctrl+M was triggering spuriously. Specifically, it was triggering when the user hit the Enter key, which is nothing like the Ctrl+M two-key combination. They defined their accelerator table like this: IDA

            A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.) The product support technician would apologize for not resolving the problem to the customer&#39;s sati
