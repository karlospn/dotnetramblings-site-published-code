      <description>
        
          
            Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is a common DevOps practice that enterprises use to provision and deploy IT infrastructure. Enterprises applying IaC and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines can maintain high availability and manage risk for their cloud environments at scale. However, multi-environment challenges, manual processes, and fragmented guidance still lead to configuration drift, errors, and inconsistencies. These issues are likely to result in downtime, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource utilization.
