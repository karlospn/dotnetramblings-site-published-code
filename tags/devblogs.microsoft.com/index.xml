            This past March we unveiled our efforts to port the TypeScript compiler and toolset to native code. This port has achieved a 10x speed-up on most projects – not just by using a natively-compiled language (Go), but also through using shared memory parallelism and concurrency where we can benefit. Since then, we have made several […]
