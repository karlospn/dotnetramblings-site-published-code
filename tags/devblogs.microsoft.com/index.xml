            A customer found that if they passed Unicode strings (which in Windows means strings encoded as UTF-16LE using the two-byte data type wchar_t as code units) which are not on even addresses, then some—but not all—functions fail to accept those strings. Why isn&#39;t this documented? This is one of the
