            When Anthropic released their Agent Skills framework, they didn&#39;t just introduce a new feature. They published a blueprint for how enterprise organizations should structure AI agent capabilities.

            Applications often need access to data without needing access to everything. Social Security numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers are common examples. Storing them is required. Exposing them broadly is not. This is especially valuable when exposing a database to an AI agent through MCP servers like SQL MCP Server, where safety and re
