This port has achieved a 10x speed-up on most projects – not just by using a natively-compiled language (Go), but also through using shared memory parallelism and concurrency where we can benefit. Since then, we have made several […]

            We’re excited to announce the preview of Azure Cosmos DB fleets. Azure Cosmos DB fleets address common challenges that developers face when building and managing multi-tenant or Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Today, many SaaS providers using Azure Cosmos DB isolate each tenant in a separate database account to meet strict performance and security […]

            This is the start of a series highlighting the integration between Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Microsoft.Extensions.AI. Future parts will provide detailed examples of using Semantic Kernel with Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions. The most common questions are: “Do Microsoft’s AI extensions replace Semantic Kernel?” “When should I use Microsoft’s AI extensions instead of Semantic Kernel?” This blog post […]

            As Semantic Kernel shifts its foundational abstractions to Microsoft.Extensions.AI, we are obsoleting and moving away from our experimental embeddings interfaces to the new standardized abstractions that provide a more consistent and powerful way to work with AI services across the .NET ecosystem. The Evolution of Embedding Generation in Semantic Kernel Semantic Kernel has always aimed […]

            Optimizing JVM Configuration for Azure Deployments Tuning the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for cloud deployments is notoriously challenging. Over 30% of developers tend to deploy Java workloads with no JVM configuration at all, therefore relying on the default settings of the HotSpot JVM. The default settings in OpenJDK are intentionally conservative, designed to work across […]
