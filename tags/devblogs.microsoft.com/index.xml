            At Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering, we are big fans of integration tests. They are the best way to test that your system works as a whole, but sometimes, integration tests are overkill or too complex to set up that the return on investment is just not worth it. That&#39;s the situation one of our teams has recently found themselves in.
