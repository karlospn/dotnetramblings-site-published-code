            I ran across a promotion from a hotel. Join us for the holidays with this promotion code. But if you read down to the fine print, it also says Limited number of rooms available for each date. May not be valid during holiday

            Just to see what happens, a customer called Set­ClipboardData(CF_TEXT) and passed a memory block that was intentionally not null-terminated. They found that when they subsequently pasted the string (say, into Notepad), the last character didn&#39;t get pasted. As a second experiment, they over-allocated the buffer b

            A customer didn&#39;t understand why their Win32 accelerator key for Ctrl+M was triggering spuriously. Specifically, it was triggering when the user hit the Enter key, which is nothing like the Ctrl+M two-key combination. They defined their accelerator table like this: IDA

            A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.) The product support technician would apologize for not resolving the problem to the customer&#39;s sati

            I struggled to get started. For ages, I kept putting off building this website, creating a new programming language for Visual Studio, and coming up with fresh color themes. Each project looked overwhelming, and I couldn’t find the time or motivation to jump in. It all just felt like too much at once. But when a national holiday gave me a

            Many languages¹ that have exceptions also have a finally clause, so you can write try { ⟦ stuff ⟧ } finally { always(); } A quick checks shows that this control structure exists in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, but not C++. C++ says, &amp;quot;We have try...finally at home.&amp;quot;

            Security vulnerabilities don&#39;t fix themselves. Someone needs to track them, prioritize them, and actually ship the fix. If you&#39;ve ever tried to manage security alerts alongside your regular sprint work, though, you know the friction: you&#39;re looking at an alert in one tab, switching to your backlog in another, trying to remember which vulner

            Say you have a shortcut file and you want to see what its target is. The natural thing to do is to call IShellLink::GetPath, which returns S_FALSE if the shortcut does not target a path, or returns S_OK and a path to the target. But for some shortcuts, it returns S_OK but produces a
