            Windows issues monthly updates, but the bigger updates happen twice a year. The one that happens in the first half of the year is called the H1 release, and the one in the second half is the H2 release. The letter H refers to &amp;quot;half&amp;quot;, which is the same pattern used by finance people to refer to the first and second halves of fiscal years. (Q
