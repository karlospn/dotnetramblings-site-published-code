            Semantic Kernel in-memory SQL processing for analytical queries In today&#39;s world, large language models (LLMs) like Azure OpenAI&#39;s GPT models have significantly changed how users interact with data-driven applications. While these models are excellent at understanding language, they can fall short on precise, structured computations.
