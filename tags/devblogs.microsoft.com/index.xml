            Many languages¹ that have exceptions also have a finally clause, so you can write try { ⟦ stuff ⟧ } finally { always(); } A quick checks shows that this control structure exists in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, but not C++. C++ says, &amp;quot;We have try...finally at home.&amp;quot;

If you&#39;ve ever tried to manage security alerts alongside your regular sprint work, though, you know the friction: you&#39;re looking at an alert in one tab, switching to your backlog in another, trying to remember which vulner

            Say you have a shortcut file and you want to see what its target is. The natural thing to do is to call IShellLink::GetPath, which returns S_FALSE if the shortcut does not target a path, or returns S_OK and a path to the target. But for some shortcuts, it returns S_OK but produces a
