            XAML Studio Open Sourced It&#39;s been over 8 years since what became XAML Studio was started. And from nearly the beginning, it was always envisioned as an open-source project… So, it&#39;s with great pleasure that I&#39;m happy to announce that day has finally come!

            Supporting re‑ranking has been one of the most common requests lately. While not always essential, it can be a valuable addition to a solution when you want to improve the precision of your results. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal, standardized API for a “re‑rank” call across providers, so the most reliable approach today is t

            Generative AI became the fastest‑growing consumer technology in history, surpassing Instagram and TikTok, reaching 100 million users in under two months. At the end of 2022, OpenAI released a free preview of GPT‑3.5, delivered as a conversational chat client: ChatGPT. The model was fine‑tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedb

            I always enjoy the quiet stretch between Christmas and New Year’s. It’s one of the few moments in the year when things slow down just enough to reflect on what actually resonated. While many of us were unplugging, our digital team was doing the opposite, editing and

            Last time, we noted that the std::rotate function requires only forward iterators. The algorithm we explored last time involved a clever sequence of reversals, but reversals require bidirectional iterators (one to iterator forward from the beginning and another to iterate backward from the end).

            Suppose you have a large block of memory, and you want to swap two blocks that reside inside that large block. For concreteness, say you have a block of memory of the form A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, E1, and you want to swap the B&#39;s and D&#39;s, producing A1, A2, D1, D2, D3, C1, C2, B1, B2, E1.
