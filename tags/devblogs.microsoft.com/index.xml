            2025 was a big year for .NET developers. We kicked things off with early .NET 10 previews, kept momentum with steady tooling and runtime improvements, and wrapped it all up with the launch of .NET 10 in November. 🚀 .NET 10 .NET 10 was the headline event of the year: the latest Long Term Support (L

            Just to see what happens, a customer called Set­ClipboardData(CF_TEXT) and passed a memory block that was intentionally not null-terminated. They found that when they subsequently pasted the string (say, into Notepad), the last character didn&#39;t get pasted. As a second experiment, they over-allocated the buffer b

            A customer didn&#39;t understand why their Win32 accelerator key for Ctrl+M was triggering spuriously. Specifically, it was triggering when the user hit the Enter key, which is nothing like the Ctrl+M two-key combination. They defined their accelerator table like this: IDA
