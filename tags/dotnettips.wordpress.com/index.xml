            Network calls create significant performance bottlenecks in modern applications due to latency and unpredictability. Developers should prioritize chunky communication and batch requests to improve efficiency, as demonstrated through API development experiences. Monitoring usage and enforcing standards can enhance performance, emphasizing that optimal design must consider the entire stack, including network performance.
