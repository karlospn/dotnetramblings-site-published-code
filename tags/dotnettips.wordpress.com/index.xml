            The excerpt from &amp;quot;Rock Your Code&amp;quot; emphasizes the importance of efficient string concatenation in .NET. It highlights the advantages of using the Span type over traditional methods, demonstrating that replacing Substring with AsSpan and leveraging the Concat function significantly enhances performance by 43 times while minimizing memory allocations.

            Visual Studio 2026 has regressed by removing or disabling key code-quality features, making development more difficult. The Analyze tool suffers from inconsistencies and lack of reliability, while various testing functionalities are also flawed. AI tools like Copilot cannot replace essential code-quality features. Greater MVP involvement and thoughtful updates are needed to enhance the IDE.
