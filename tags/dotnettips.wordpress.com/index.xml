            These articles delve into strategies for optimizing the performance of your reference types and structures, also known as user-defined types. Both exhibit distinct behaviors, given that reference types are instantiated on the memory heap, overseen by the Garbage Collector, while structures are created on the memory stack, offering potentially superior performance.
