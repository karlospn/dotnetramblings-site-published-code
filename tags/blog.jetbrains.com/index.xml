            “Not a constant expression.” You’ve seen the diagnostics and the note trail, but never the actual state. Until now. Modern C++ pushes more logic into constexpr/consteval: parsers, tables, DSLs, hashing – real code with real branches. When code fails at compile time, you can either try to guess the reason from the compiler’s notes or […]

In TeamCity, the traditional approach for publishing […]
