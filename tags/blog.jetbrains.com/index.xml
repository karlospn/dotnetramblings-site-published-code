            Code completion has always been a defining strength of JetBrains products. So, when adding AI into our products, we knew it had to deliver top-tier code completion. This post covers how we trained the model behind our cloud-based completion. Initial research: What about obvious model options? We started by testing both closed-source LLMs via APIs […]

            We recently released some new AI features for the JetBrains Academy plugin. Learners will now be able to use machine translation of course content, theory lookup, and AI hints for Kotlin courses. At first glance, these might seem fairly tame. There are no big LLM integrations, JetBrains AI Assistant is not being marketed toward beginners, […]

            Spring Framework 6.2 introduced MockMvcTester to support writing AssertJ style assertions using AssertJ under the hood. If you’re using Spring Boot, the spring-boot-starter-test dependency transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as mockito, assertj, json-path, jsonassert, etc. So, if you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 (which uses Spring framework 6.2) or any later version, […]

            Software development moves fast – really fast. It can also involve multiple teams working from different locations around the world. However, while speed and collaboration can be great for developers and businesses, they can also create security challenges. With more entry points and less time to catch potential threats, each commit, build, and deployment is […]

            Aqua was originally developed as a dedicated IDE for QA engineers working in automated testing. After carefully evaluating adoption rates, market trends, and user feedback, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the product. While this was not an easy choice, Aqua did not reach the level of adoption we had anticipated. We believe […]
