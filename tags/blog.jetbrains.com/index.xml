            Until now, Qodana linters have run exclusively in Docker containers. While this approach provided consistency and isolation, it also required significant effort for environment configuration, particularly for complex project setups or highly secured systems. Users have had to rely on the bootstrap mechanism to set up custom environments inside the Docker container, often duplicating the […]

            To comply with the Omnibus Directive 2019/2161, JetBrains Marketplace requires plugin vendors to declare whether they act as professional traders or not.

            When debugging Java programs, developers are often under the impression that they’re interacting directly with the source code. This isn’t surprising – Java’s tooling does such an excellent job of hiding the complexity that it almost feels as if the source code exists at runtime. If you’re just starting with Java, you likely remember those […]

            We’re thrilled to announce that ReSharper 2025.2 EAP 2 is the first public build to introduce support for running ReSharper out-of-process (OOP) with Microsoft Visual Studio. This long-anticipated architectural change lays the foundation for better stability and performance in the future, as it decouples the ReSharper process from the Visual Studio one. More on that […]

            When we prepared to release IntelliJ IDEA support for Kotlin 2.0, a major milestone for their compiler and ecosystem, their QA team faced a formidable challenge: how to ensure consistent, reliable quality across a complex and evolving codebase without slowing down development. With the Kotlin compiler, IDE plugin, and numerous inspections being refactored and rewritten, […]
