            Cloud development environments (CDEs) have become a game-changer for development teams, and for good reason. They simplify workflows, reduce project setup time, and eliminate configuration headaches. While most discussions about CDEs focus exclusively on software developers, in reality, the benefits of CDEs extend far beyond coders. They can boost productivity for every team member involved [â€¦]

            Search for Python web frameworks, and three names will consistently come up: Django, Flask, and FastAPI. Our latest Python Developer Survey Results confirm that these three frameworks remain developersâ€™ top choices for backend web development with Python. All three frameworks are open-source and compatible with the latest versions of Python.Â But how do you determine [â€¦]

            AI models are evolving fast, and DeepSeek-R1 is making waves as a serious competitor to OpenAI. But how well do these models understand Kotlin? Can they generate reliable code, explain tricky concepts, and help with debugging? JetBrains Research tested the latest AI models, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, and OpenAI o3-mini, using KotlinHumanEval and a new [â€¦]

            Database migrations are critical to modern application development and deployment, enabling teams to evolve their database schema alongside their application code. However, as systems grow in complexity and scale, managing migrations becomes increasingly challenging. At scale, a simple schema update can impact several microservices, terabytes of data, and global user traffic. It requires careful planning, [â€¦]
