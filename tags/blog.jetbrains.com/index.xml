            I’ll start by acknowledging that you probably already do. And honestly? We get it. Programming is hard! Learning materials can be poorly structured and lack good visualizations. Sometimes your teacher is a math genius who is bad at talking. And hey, AI is pretty capable for beginner-level problems. It can make the implementation much faster […]

            This summer, we’re making Mellum, our code completion model, easier for developers to use locally, and we’re introducing support for more languages than ever. Here’s what’s new: Mellum-all – now on Hugging Face We’ve just released Mellum-all, the next open-source installation of Mellum, which has been trained to support all major programming languages.

            Let’s be honest: if you’re in software today, AI is already on your team—whether you’ve invited it or not. But here’s the critical truth every developer and team lead should understand: using AI tools is not the same as understanding AI agents. That’s why we created the course AI Agents as Your Team. It’s a […]

            Build steps are often repeated over and over – within a single project or team, or even across a whole organization. These patterns tend to get copy-pasted, manually adapted, and maintained in parallel. This can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work. With the latest TeamCity release, we’re addressing that problem head-on. Say hello to […]

            Modern development is fast-paced – bugs, style violations, and code smells need to be caught early and fixed quickly. It’s also time-consuming and tedious to manually make fixes. That’s why Qodana’s Quick-Fix feature is designed to go beyond static analysis – it automatically improves your codebase using predefined strategies that fit your team’s needs. Quick-Fix […]

            CodeCanvas 2025.2 is here, and this release is packed with updates we think you’ll like. The main highlight is the support for Cursor and Jupyter notebooks. But there’s plenty more under the hood, including network policy controls, usage limits, and a bunch of smaller but useful improvements. Cursor support Cursor is one of the fastest-growing […]

This shift allows us to tackle long-standing issues and improve the overall experience of working with Bazel projects in JetBrains IDEs. As of July 2025, these plugins are no longer offered by, nor affiliated with, Google. What’s […]

            For the past three years, we’ve worked hard to maintain our subscription prices while improving our products, building new tools, and adding features across our entire toolset. Like many businesses, we’re facing rising costs due to inflation. This means we can no longer keep our subscription prices at the current levels. The new prices will […]

            What is Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)? “Global Interpreter Lock” (or “GIL”) is a familiar term in the Python community. It is a well-known Python feature. But what exactly is a GIL? If you have experience with other programming languages (Rust, for example), you may already know what a mutex is. It’s an abbreviation for […]
