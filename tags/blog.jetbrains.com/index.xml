            This article was brought to you by Jakkie Koekemoer &amp;amp; Shweta, draft.dev. Traditional wisdom in the dev world is that once you opt for proprietary APIs or vendor-specific tooling, migrating to alternative platforms is costly or impractical to adopt in the future. That’s why engineering teams have considered vendor lock-in a trap. You end up […]

            IntelliJ IDEA is well-known for its Spring Framework support. The IDE helps with bean navigation, on-the-go bean injection, Spring Data methods completion, and assistance with generating HTTP requests for controllers. One of the areas that IDEA is good at is dealing with JPA. You, as a developer, can: Before IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, dealing with Spring […]

            In December 2024, we published a year-in-review summary of our work on the Scala Plugin. By that time the following year, we were busy releasing IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala Plugin 2025.3, as well as preparing for the upcoming Scala 3.8 release. This was followed by a long holiday break. But as they say, not […]

            TL;DR Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS/TS) are often perceived as rivals, but in reality, they’re complementary languages that serve different purposes and excel across different domains. They were designed with different goals in mind, which dictate the best use cases for each. JavaScript/TypeScript offers benefits such as unmatched flexibility, a massive ecosystem, and rapid iteration. Meanwhile, […]

            Previously in this series: Agents eventually run out of context. When they do, they crash, and you lose everything mid-task. We’ve been running GPT-5 Codex since Part 1. It scores 0.58 on SWE-bench Verified. We tried Claude Sonnet 4.5 next, which scored 0.6 and ran faster on most tasks. But complex problems hit Claude’s 200K […]
