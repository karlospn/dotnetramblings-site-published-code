            The latest EAP build of CLion 2025.3, released yesterday, includes support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), which allows CLion to communicate with a variety of additional debuggers.

            Around 15 years ago, I got my first assistant job at a university department. Frankly, I only used ReSharper for its solution-wide analysis, which would alert me whenever I broke the spaghetti code I got served. I did not know about all the refactorings yet. It was only at my second job that my awesome […]

            If you’ve ever tried building a system of multiple AI agents, you’ve probably run into the problem. It starts simple enough: You’ve got one agent writing blog posts, another proofreading them, and maybe a third suggesting or generating images. Individually, they’re effective. But getting them to work together? That’s where things might start falling apart. […]

As with any new Visual Studio version, one of the first questions developers ask is: “Will my extensions work after updating – especially ReSharper?”. The short answer is a resounding “yes”. But there’s more to the story, and […]

            TL;DR Over the past few years, AI has made remarkable progress, but it doesn’t always deliver what professional developers need. One key reason is that most models are trained on public datasets that don’t reflect the complex, real-world scenarios faced by professional developers every day. Without such real-world data, our AI tools will fall short. […]
