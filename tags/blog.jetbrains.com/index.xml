            TL;DR Over the past few years, AI has made remarkable progress, but it doesn‚Äôt always deliver what professional developers need. One key reason is that most models are trained on public datasets that don‚Äôt reflect the complex, real-world scenarios faced by professional developers every day. Without such real-world data, our AI tools will fall short. [‚Ä¶]

            Test generation is an essential yet time-consuming part of quality assurance. Automating test-generation techniques means accelerating the development process and improving the quality of the final software. However, traditional automated techniques, and their respective tools, are not usually user-friendly, having a command-line interface and not being integrated with the IDE. To boost acceleration and quality [‚Ä¶]
