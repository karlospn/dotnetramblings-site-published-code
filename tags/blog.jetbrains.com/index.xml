Thanks to its effectiveness in detecting critical software flaws, fuzzing has gained widespread use […]

            April is always a busy month in tech. For example, in April 1986, IBM became the first to use a megabit chip. In 1991, Java development began in earnest. And, of course, there’s April Fools’ Day – perfect for programming jokes and clever pranks. This April is certainly no exception! Check out fresh courses, events, […]

            This tutorial was brought to you by Rajkumar Venkatasamy, draft.dev. Microservice architecture has become a cornerstone for building scalable and maintainable applications. Microservices allow individual services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, resulting in faster delivery cycles and improved fault isolation. For example, an e-commerce platform can use independent services to handle product catalogs, […]
