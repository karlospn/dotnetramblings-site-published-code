            A year ago, we introduced a free non-commercial use license option for JetBrains Rider, hoping to remove barriers for developers who code with no financial objective in mind for their projects.

            Did you know? Calling GC.Collect() explicitly forces the garbage collector to run and reclaim memory from unreachable objects. However, it’s generally discouraged to use this method in most applications because the garbage collector is highly optimized to run automatically. Forcing it can lead to performance issues by interrupting the normal optimization process. Welcome to dotInsights […]

            This article is brought to you by Mdu Sibisi, draft.dev. Long build times interfere with developer momentum, disrupt flow states, and negatively impact productivity. While seemingly minor gaps in work rate may appear negligible in the moment, they quickly accumulate into significant increases in release cycle times and infrastructure costs. (There’s a reason high-performance development […]

            Imagine you’re working on a project and jotting down every single idea, experiment, and failure. After a while, your notes pile up so high that finding what’s useful takes more time and energy than the work itself. A similar problem faces users of software engineering (SE) agents: the agents “take notes” on every generated output, […]
