            We recently released Koog 0.5.0, introducing full Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol support, which makes it easier than ever to build systems of interconnected AI agents in Kotlin.

            We started the development of CodeCanvas back in 2022, with the strong belief that cloud development environments (CDEs) would make development faster, smoother, and more efficient. With this goal in mind, we launched CodeCanvas publicly in 2024 and started accumulating users. We dove into the issues they faced in their development workflows and how we […]
