            Seamless in-IDE coding and async development with Junie Software development has been significantly influenced by AI coding agents taking over more repetitive tasks, generating code faster and getting more done with less effort. It’s nice to have access to a fast coding agent or an in-IDE AI assistant, but in real-world scenarios, intelligence and trustworthiness […]

            At AI Summit London 2025, Kris Kang, Head of Product for AI at JetBrains, gave a talk that questioned a common belief in AI development: that bigger means better. The industry has focused heavily on massive, general-purpose language models. These models offer impressive capabilities, but the cost of building and running them at scale is […]

            While building Spring Boot applications, you can leverage Testcontainers to spin up any required services, such as a database or messaging broker, as Docker containers at application startup. This enables a ready-to-code setup, minimizing environment friction so you can focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable code. For database-driven development, IntelliJ IDEA provides enterprise-grade, professional-level tooling out […]

            Did you know? Because of C#’s ability to use verbatim strings, you can use reserved keywords as variable names by prefixing them with the @ symbol. For example, var @class = new Class(); is a perfectly valid statement to make an instance of the Class class. But keep in mind – just because you could […]
