            AI is more like a megaphone than a magic wand. It amplifies what is already there. Whatever habits you bring to your workflow, good or bad, AI will turn up the volume. Every untested component, undocumented design, and ill-specified feature, to name a few, becomes louder when AI enters the mix. Teams with a clear […]

            Looking back Hello, friends! 10 years ago to this very day, DataGrip was born. That’s right, on December 16, 2016, the first-ever version of DataGrip was released! But the origins of DataGrip go back even further. We had already been working to create a database IDE for quite some time by then, and its codename […]

            C and C++ are the backbone of modern software. Operating systems, databases, game engines, and compilers all trace their roots to these languages. They give developers low-level control over memory, hardware, and performance. It’s a level of control that has defined decades of software development. However, the landscape has shifted, and the Rust vs. C++ […]

            Over the past few weeks, after we announced ACP protocol support, I’ve gotten lots of messages asking something along these lines: “Microsoft just launched AgentHQ for GitHub and VS Code. So, does this mean JetBrains will drop ACP? Will you only support your own thing now?” The quick answer: We’re not picking sides. Here’s why – […]

Code quality checks that worked well for one repository or service often need a more resilient, automated, and infrastructure-native setup when development ecosystems grow. That’s exactly why we’re excited to introduce first-class Kubernetes support for Qodana, bringing fully automated deployments, lifecycle management, and future-ready […]

            Benchmarking is an important part of writing efficient Kotlin code. The kotlinx-benchmark library helps you measure and compare performance across different implementations or hardware configurations. However, raw text results only take you so far. Sometimes you need to visualize your data, not just read it. That’s where Kotlin notebooks come in. Kotlin notebooks combine the […]
