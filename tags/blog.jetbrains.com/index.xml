            When the engineering team at Syncfusion set out to build BoldSign, a modern e-signature platform, they knew speed and stability would be critical. Supporting 40,000+ organizations across industries like finance, legal, and IT, BoldSign had to offer fast, secure document signing at scale without slowing down its own development cycles in the process. But as adoption grew, so […]

            This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field. Python’s flexibility and ease of use make it a go-to language for developers, but its interpreted nature and global interpreter lock (GIL) can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in large-scale or resource-intensive […]

            At JetBrains, we’ve spent 25 years building tools for developers. Over the past two years, we’ve seen that AI isn’t just changing how developers write code – it’s beginning to reshape the entire process of product development. Not only is AI making developers more productive, helping with everything from code completion to testing and deployment, […]

            This article was written by an external contributor. When it comes to writing short scripts or CRUDs, Python is a great choice. With its rich ecosystem and broad adoption, it can be easily used to scrape some data or to perform data analysis. However, maintaining a large codebase in Python can be very problematic. Python’s […]
