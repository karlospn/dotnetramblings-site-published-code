            This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev. Docker has changed the way we build and ship software. Instead of wrestling with “it works on my machine” issues, developers can now package applications and all their dependencies into a neat, portable container that runs anywhere. No wonder Docker has become the de facto […]

            Hi DataGrip and Database Tools community, Shortly after the 2025.3 release, your feedback made it clear that the redesigned workflow for query files and query consoles introduced issues in several important scenarios, especially when working with global data sources. After reviewing the impact, we’ve decided that the best course of action is to revert this […]

            Adopting Kotlin in a Java-centric company is not about flipping a switch or rewriting everything “the right way”. It’s about people, timing, risk, and trust. Over the last four weeks, we’ve published a series of blog posts by Urs Peter, covering all of these aspects of migrating to Kotlin. In this post, we’ll tie the […]

            AI is more like a megaphone than a magic wand. It amplifies what is already there. Whatever habits you bring to your workflow, good or bad, AI will turn up the volume. Every untested component, undocumented design, and ill-specified feature, to name a few, becomes louder when AI enters the mix.

That’s right, on December 16, 2016, the first-ever version of DataGrip was released! But the origins of DataGrip go back even further. We had already been working to create a database IDE for quite some time by then, and its codename […]

            C and C++ are the backbone of modern software. Operating systems, databases, game engines, and compilers all trace their roots to these languages. They give developers low-level control over memory, hardware, and performance. It’s a level of control that has defined decades of software development. However, the landscape has shifted, and the Rust vs. C++ […]

So, does this mean JetBrains will drop ACP? Will you only support your own thing now?” The quick answer: We’re not picking sides. Here’s why – […]
