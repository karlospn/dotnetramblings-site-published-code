            You‚Äôve likely used String variables to store values that span multiple lines, such as LLM prompts, JSON, HTML, XML, code snippets, and other such values. Some of these, such as a JSON value, include double quotes as part of the data. Imagine the inconvenience of using backslashes () to escape those quotes, indenting lines using [‚Ä¶]
