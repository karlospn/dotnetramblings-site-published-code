            Developer experience is not only about nice editors and fast build times. It is about reducing friction so developers can focus on solving problems rather than fighting with tools. Among the most effective developer experience tools available today is static code analysis. By examining code without running it, static analysis surfaces potential issues early and [‚Ä¶]
