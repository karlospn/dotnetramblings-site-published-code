            TL;DR: The Kotlin Foundation is launching a mentorship program that pairs experienced open-source maintainers with new Kotlin contributors to help them make their first meaningful contributions, with branded swag and a chance to win a trip to KotlinConf. I still remember my first contribution to an open-source library. It was Typhoon, a widely popular dependency […]

            When people think about tooling for Android development, the conversation often gravitates towards platform-specific concerns: UI performance, layout validation, device compatibility, or resource management. Yet for many Android teams, the most persistent challenges don’t sit at the platform level – they’re in the team’s Kotlin codebase itself. As Android projects scale, Kotlin brings strong language […]

            This article was brought to you by Jakkie Koekemoer &amp;amp; Shweta, draft.dev. Traditional wisdom in the dev world is that once you opt for proprietary APIs or vendor-specific tooling, migrating to alternative platforms is costly or impractical to adopt in the future. That’s why engineering teams have considered vendor lock-in a trap. You end up […]

            IntelliJ IDEA is well-known for its Spring Framework support. The IDE helps with bean navigation, on-the-go bean injection, Spring Data methods completion, and assistance with generating HTTP requests for controllers. One of the areas that IDEA is good at is dealing with JPA. You, as a developer, can: Before IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, dealing with Spring […]

            TL;DR Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS/TS) are often perceived as rivals, but in reality, they’re complementary languages that serve different purposes and excel across different domains. They were designed with different goals in mind, which dictate the best use cases for each. JavaScript/TypeScript offers benefits such as unmatched flexibility, a massive ecosystem, and rapid iteration. Meanwhile, […]
