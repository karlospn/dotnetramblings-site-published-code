            Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding emotions in text. While there are many ways to approach sentiment analysis, including more traditional lexicon-based and machine learning approaches, today we’ll be focusing on one of the most cutting-edge ways of working with text – large language models (LLMs). We’ll explain how you can use these […]

            Trapped in the insights loop As GreenJinn scaled, its tech and engineering team became overwhelmed with data extraction requests from non-technical teams, including operations, insights, sales, and marketing. These teams relied on the tech department for all their data needs, creating a bottleneck that slowed down operations and disrupted product development. The insights loop was a repetitive cycle. The […]

            Last year Gradle announced a new experimental project called Declarative Gradle that aims to make Gradle build scripts easier to read and use. Instead of writing detailed instructions for how to build your project, Declarative Gradle allows you to describe what your software needs (like libraries, applications, or tests) in a clear and simple way.

            I’m not a competitive programmer – far from it. I never received formal education in advanced algorithms and data structures. In fact, I can’t even implement Dijkstra’s algorithm without referring to Wikipedia. Yet, I still participate in Advent of Code competitions. I’ve never made it onto an official leaderboard; I’m too slow for that. Completing […]
