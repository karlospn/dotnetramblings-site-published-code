Sometimes your teacher is a math genius who is bad at talking. And hey, AI is pretty capable for beginner-level problems. It can make the implementation much faster […]

But here’s the critical truth every developer and team lead should understand: using AI tools is not the same as understanding AI agents. That’s why we created the course AI Agents as Your Team.

            Build steps are often repeated over and over – within a single project or team, or even across a whole organization. These patterns tend to get copy-pasted, manually adapted, and maintained in parallel. This can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work. With the latest TeamCity release, we’re addressing that problem head-on. Say hello to […]
