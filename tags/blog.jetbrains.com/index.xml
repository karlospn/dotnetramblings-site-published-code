            Let’s be honest: if you’re in software today, AI is already on your team—whether you’ve invited it or not. But here’s the critical truth every developer and team lead should understand: using AI tools is not the same as understanding AI agents. That’s why we created the course AI Agents as Your Team. It’s a […]

            Build steps are often repeated over and over – within a single project or team, or even across a whole organization. These patterns tend to get copy-pasted, manually adapted, and maintained in parallel. This can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work. With the latest TeamCity release, we’re addressing that problem head-on. Say hello to […]

            For the past three years, we’ve worked hard to maintain our subscription prices while improving our products, building new tools, and adding features across our entire toolset. Like many businesses, we’re facing rising costs due to inflation. This means we can no longer keep our subscription prices at the current levels. The new prices will […]
