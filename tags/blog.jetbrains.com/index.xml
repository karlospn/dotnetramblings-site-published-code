            Spring Framework’s declarative transaction management is incredibly powerful, allowing developers to simply add the @Transactional annotation to a method and let Spring handle the transaction details. However, misconfigurations or misunderstandings of how transactions work can lead to frustrating database transaction handling issues. Debugging these problems often means sifting through a lot of AOP proxy code, […]

The ?? operator (null-coalescing operator) returns the left-hand operand if it is not null; otherwise, it evaluates and returns the right-hand operand. The ??= operator (null-coalescing assignment operator) assigns the right-hand operand’s value to the left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand is null. Welcome to […]
