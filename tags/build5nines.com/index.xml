            When working with LLMs, an extremely valuable use case is generating structured data as the output response of the AI prompt. Whether you’re building an app, prototyping a data pipeline, or performing data extraction or transformation, receiving structured outputs like JSON saves time and makes downstream processing seamless. But there’s a challenge: these models are […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid JSON Data was originally published on Build5Nines.

            There are few companies in the history of technology — or business, for that matter — that can say they changed the world. Even fewer can say they did it more than once. As Microsoft marks its 50th anniversary, it’s hard not to marvel at just how much of our modern digital life bears its […] The article From BASIC to Copilot: 50 Years of Microsoft Technology Innovation and Leadership was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Few names carry as much respect and recognition among software developers as Anders Hejlsberg. As the creator of Turbo Pascal, the chief architect of Delphi, the original designer of C#, and now the lead architect of TypeScript, Hejlsberg has shaped the way millions of developers write code daily. While his earlier work transformed client-side and […] The article Big Thinkers: Anders Hejlsberg – The Architect Shaping the Cloud’s Programming Future from C# to TypeScript was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the way we build software. But as the scope of intelligent applications grows, so does the need for structured, contextual communication between LLMs and real-world data, services, and business logic. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in — a lightweight but powerful standard for exposing structured […] The article How to Build and Deploy an MCP Server with TypeScript and Azure Developer CLI (azd) using Azure Container Apps and Docker was originally published on Build5Nines.
