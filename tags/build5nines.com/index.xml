            Since I’ve been working with Azure OpenAI Service from a developer perspective as well, I’ve decided to build a sample application to help demonstrate not just the IaC deployment of Azure OpenAI Service and GPT models, but also to demonstrate some basic use cases of integrating AI into your own enterprise applications. Here’s a screenshot […] The article Introducing AIChatUI: Open Source AI Chat Sample with Azure OpenAI Service &amp;amp; GPT-3 / GPT-4 appeared first on Build5Nines.

            GitHub Actions are great at enabling you to automate workflows directly from within a GitHub repository. The workflows are stored in a YAML definition file located within the .github/workflows directory within the repository. GitHub Actions can be used to configure workflows that can perform a variety of actions to perform build and release steps.

            It was once a new concept that enterprises were trying to make sense of, but the term “cloud” has really become ubiquitous across the IT landscape. No matter the industry, your organization is likely depending on some cloud services; from Microsoft Azure, AWS, Microsoft 365, Slack, Teams, GitHub, to so many other services.

            HashiCorp Terraform empowers DevOps Engineers and SREs to manage cloud resources efficiently. One of its standout features is the Terraform Modules support, allowing users to organize and reuse infrastructure code effectively as reusable modules. While Terraform’s native module registry serves as a central hub for sharing modules, sometimes you may prefer hosting modules in your […] The article Terraform: Modules using Git Branch as Source appeared first on Build5Nines.

            In HashiCorp Terraform, data sources serve as a bridge between the Terraform configuration and external systems or information. Essentially, data sources allow Terraform to query external resources, such as cloud platforms, APIs, databases, or other systems, and use the retrieved information within the configuration. Unlike resources, which represent infrastructure components to be managed by Terraform, […] The article Terraform: How are Data Sources used? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            When using HashiCorp Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of choice, it becomes critical to organize the Terraform code as the Terraform project becomes more complex. One of the most common practices is to split the Terraform project from a single file (typically named main.tf) into multiple smaller files. This helps increase maintainability […] The article Terraform: Split main.tf into seperate files appeared first on Build5Nines.
