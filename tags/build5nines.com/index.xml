            By combining Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Generative AI, you can create a more intelligent and context aware AI solution that can more accurately generate text responses. I’ve previously written about building a generative AI application using C#, Phi-3 and the ONNX Runtime. This article will take the foundation covered in that article and add […] The article Build a Generative AI + RAG App in C# with Phi-3, ONNX, and SharpVector was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Running jobs on specific branches with GitHub Actions is a common scenario implemented by DevOps and SRE professionals. This allows you to control which branches trigger specific jobs within your workflows. This can be important for maintaining efficient CI/CD processes, especially if you want tests to run on every branch while restricting deployment actions to […] The article Configuring GitHub Actions to Run Jobs on Specific Branches was originally published on Build5Nines.
