            When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), generating structured outputs like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is invaluable for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and integration with spreadsheet applications. However, since LLMs are primarily optimized for natural language generation, crafting prompts that yield valid CSV-formatted data requires careful engineering. This article provides strategies and examples to […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid CSV Data was originally published on Build5Nines.

            The ability to extract and semantically search through unstructured documents is becoming not just a convenience, but a necessity. This is especially true for software developers working with large repositories of technical documentation, compliance reports, or knowledge bases. In this article, we’ll explore how to build a semantic search solution using C#, PDFs, and the […] The article Semantic Search PDF Files Locally using .NET / C# and Build5Nines.SharpVector was originally published on Build5Nines.

            When building Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM-based solutions, the quality and structure of input data significantly influences the performance of the LLM models. PDF documents, a prevalent format for information dissemination, often contain rich textual content that can be harnessed for such applications. However, extracting this content in a structured and usable format […] The article Extract Text from PDF Files with Python for use in Generative AI and RAG Solutions was originally published on Build5Nines.
