            Microsoft Azure offers a broad range of cloud services, and as enterprise deployments grow in complexity, having a clear visual representation can become crucial. Microsoft Visio is an excellent tool for modeling and documenting your Azure infrastructure. This article explores the tools available for you to create Azure architecture diagrams using Microsoft Visio—using built-in templates, […] The article Create Azure Architecture Diagrams with Microsoft Visio was originally published on Build5Nines.

            The need to efficiently search and retrieve documents based on their semantic content is more important than ever—especially when building Generative AI systems that implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern. One robust approach to achieve this is by using vector representations of text data. These vectors, generated using advanced embedding models like Azure […] The article Enhanced In-Memory Text Vector Search in .NET with SharpVector and OpenAI Embeddings was originally published on Build5Nines.

            The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is a powerful tool for accelerating application deployment to Microsoft Azure. While azd defaults to Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment, you can configure it to work with HashiCorp Terraform too! This enables azd to be configured not just for Terraform deployments, but also to support cloud-agnostic IaC […] The article Configure Azure Developer CLI (azd) for HashiCorp Terraform Infrastructure Deployment was originally published on Build5Nines.
