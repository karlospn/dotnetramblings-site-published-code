            Azure Storage Accounts are a fundamental part of cloud storage in Microsoft Azure, providing various types of storage services such as blobs, files, tables, and queues. Understanding the total size allocated to a storage account and the usage breakdown per service type is crucial for optimizing costs, managing capacity, and ensuring efficient data storage management. […] The article Get Total Size Allocated to Azure Storage Account (Blobs, Files, Tables and Queues) was originally published on Build5Nines.

            When moving or duplicating Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), you may encounter an issue where the VM’s disk is offline due to a signature collision. This commonly happens when: Since Windows assigns a unique identifier (disk signature) to each disk, if two disks have identical signatures, Windows prevents conflicts by marking one disk as Offline. The […] The article Fixing Disk Signature Collision in Azure VM After Cloning or Using Snapshots with Windows was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Microsoft Azure Service Fabric has been a foundational platform for building and managing microservices-based applications since its release. However, with the rise of Kubernetes and other container orchestration tools, its adoption has seen changes over the years. Additionally, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Fabric, a new data and analytics platform, leading to some confusion between the two […] The article Azure Service Fabric: Is it still relevant? Service Fabric vs Microsoft Fabric? was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Generative AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o process natural language input through a series of computational steps: tokenization, numerical representation, neural processing, and text generation. While these models have achieved impressive performance in understanding and generating text, they sometimes struggle with seemingly simple tasks, such as counting letters in a word. This […] The article How Generative AI Uses Text Tokens to Generate a Response was originally published on Build5Nines.
