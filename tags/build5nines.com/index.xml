            Generative AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o process natural language input through a series of computational steps: tokenization, numerical representation, neural processing, and text generation. While these models have achieved impressive performance in understanding and generating text, they sometimes struggle with seemingly simple tasks, such as counting letters in a word.
