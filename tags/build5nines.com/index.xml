            In HashiCorp Terraform, data sources serve as a bridge between the Terraform configuration and external systems or information. Essentially, data sources allow Terraform to query external resources, such as cloud platforms, APIs, databases, or other systems, and use the retrieved information within the configuration. Unlike resources, which represent infrastructure components to be managed by Terraform, […] The article Terraform: How are Data Sources used? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            When using HashiCorp Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of choice, it becomes critical to organize the Terraform code as the Terraform project becomes more complex. One of the most common practices is to split the Terraform project from a single file (typically named main.tf) into multiple smaller files. This helps increase maintainability […] The article Terraform: Split main.tf into seperate files appeared first on Build5Nines.

            Terraform’s declarative approach allows for defining infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling teams to automate the deployment and management of resources across various cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. As infrastructure evolves, there may arise a need to remove resources from the Terraform state that are no longer required. When you manually delete resources […] The article Terraform: Remove Resource from State File (.tfstate) appeared first on Build5Nines.

            The Microsoft Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network) provides secure, reliable content delivery with a broad global reach along with rich features. The Azure CDN POP (point of presence) locations are not the same as the Azure Region locations, and Microsoft has the list of cities for the CDN locations published in the Azure documentation. However, […] The article Azure CDN POP Locations: Interactive Map of Azure CDN Points of Presence appeared first on Build5Nines.

            With Infrastructure as Code (IaC), every aspect of an organization’s infrastructure is defined and managed through code. This infrastructure deployment and configuration automation makes managing the organizations infrastructure much easier over time. Also, by committing the IaC code that configurations the infrastructure into source control, there are change tracking and other benefits for the organizations […] The article Benefits of Convention over Configuration for IaC Deployment Projects appeared first on Build5Nines.
