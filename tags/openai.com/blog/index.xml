            Codex is a cloud-based coding agent. Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI o3 optimized for software engineering. codex-1 was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and iteratively runs tests until passing results are achieved.

            Introducing Codex: a cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel, powered by codex-1. With Codex, developers can simultaneously deploy multiple agents to independently handle coding tasks such as writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review.
