In an earlier post, we discussed how you can build private and secure enterprise generative AI applications with Amazon Q Business and AWS IAM Identity Center. If you want to use Amazon Q Business to build enterprise generative AI applications, and have yet to adopt organization-wide use of AWS IAM Identity Center, you can use Amazon Q Business IAM Federation to directly manage user access to Amazon Q Business applications from your enterprise identity provider (IdP), such as Okta or Ping Identity. Amazon Q Business IAM Federation uses Federation with IAM and doesn’t require the use of IAM Identity Center. This post shows how you can use Amazon Q Business IAM Federation for user access management of your Amazon Q Business applications.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-private-and-secure-enterprise-generative-ai-applications-with-amazon-q-business-using-iam-federation/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/23_08_2024/23_08_2024_1/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Build private and secure enterprise generative AI applications with Amazon Q Business using IAM Federation"},{"body":"In this post, we describe the development of the automated summary feature in Verisk's Discovery Navigator incorporating generative AI, the data, the architecture, and the evaluation of the pipeline.
