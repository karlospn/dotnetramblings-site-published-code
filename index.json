This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used. In this post, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a 1.8 times speedup observed on a sample dataset.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/achieve-2x-speed-up-in-llm-inference-with-medusa-1-on-amazon-sagemaker-ai/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/12_02_2025/12_02_2025_4/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Achieve ~2x speed-up in LLM inference with Medusa-1 on Amazon SageMaker AI"},{"body":"This blog post explores LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation, providing comprehensive guidance on feature setup, evaluating job initiation through both the console and Python SDK and APIs, and demonstrating how this innovative evaluation feature can enhance generative AI applications across multiple metric categories including quality, user experience, instruction following, and safety.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/llm-as-a-judge-on-amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/12_02_2025/12_02_2025_5/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation"},{"body":"This post announces the new and improved Azure Storage Data Movement library for .NET.\nLink to article: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/simplify-your-net-data-transfers-with-the-new-azure-storage-data-movement-library ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/12_02_2025/12_02_2025_6/","section":"post","tags":["devblogs.microsoft.com"],"title":"Simplify your .NET data transfers with the new Azure Storage Data Movement library"},{"body":"In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems.
