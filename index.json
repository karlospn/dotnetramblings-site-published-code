You have a lot of choices around which models to use and how best to interact with them. In this post I want to go through the steps to implement a basic chat with an LLM hosted in Azure using C#, by taking advantage of the new Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package, which aims to simplify the process. There's a helpful tutorial available here, but there were a few permissions-related issues I ran into along the way, so I thought I'd document how I got it working myself. Step 1 - Create an Azure Open AI Model Deployment To start with, we need to create an AI model \u0026quot;deployment\u0026quot; in Azure. This can be done fairly simply in the Azure portal. First, create an \u0026quot;Azure OpenAI Service\u0026quot; resource, and then within it, you need to create a model \u0026quot;deployment\u0026quot;. This is one of the first points where it gets a bit confusing as there are several models to choose from and its not at all obvious if you are new to AI how to decide which one is the most appropriate. Essentially you're trading off cost, performance and capabilities, and for this tutorial, gpt-4o-mini would be a good choice. You'll need to take note of the Open AI service endpoint, which will be something like https://my-openai.openai.azure.com/, as well as the name of your deployment, e.g. \u0026quot;my-gpt-4o-mini\u0026quot;. Step 2 - Grant yourself the necessary permissions to use the model If you want to use EntraID for authenticating, then you'll need to grant yourself the necessary permissions to use the model deployment. This can be done by visiting the \u0026quot;Access control (IAM)\u0026quot; section of the portal for the OpenAI service and adding a role assignment of Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor to your user (I originally tried the \u0026quot;Cognitive Services OpenAI User\u0026quot; role but that didn't seem to be enough although I'm not sure why not). Step 3 - Call the model from C# In a C# console app, add references to the latest versions of the following packages: And then to actually connect to our Azure OpenAI service we can use DefaultAzureCredential. I find I often need to explicitly specify which tenant my resources are in, so I've shown how to do that with DefaultAzureCredentialOptions. You may also need to log into Azure with the Azure CLI using az login before this credential will work for you. var endpoint = \u0026quot;https://my-openai.openai.azure.com/\u0026quot;; var modelId = \u0026quot;my-gpt-4o-mini\u0026quot;; // this is the deployment name var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions() {\nTenantId = \u0026quot;123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\u0026quot; }); IChatClient client = new AzureOpenAIClient( new Uri(endpoint), credential) .AsChatClient(modelId);\nAnd now submitting a question to the chat client is very straightforward: var response = await client.CompleteAsync(\u0026quot;Should I learn about AI in 2025?\u0026quot;); Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\nI'll leave you to guess what the AI said in response! Using key-based authentication If you'd prefer to use key-based authentication, then you can access the key for your OpenAI service from the Azure portal. Dotnet secrets would be a good way to make your key available for local development, which you can set up by running the following commands in your project folder. dotnet user-secrets init dotnet user-secrets set \u0026quot;AzureOpenAI:ApiKey\u0026quot; \u0026quot;your-api-key-here\u0026quot; dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables\nAnd then in your Program.cs file, you can get the secret from configuration and construct an ApiKeyCredential with it. var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddUserSecrets() .AddEnvironmentVariables(); var configuration = builder.Build(); var apiKey = configuration[\u0026quot;AzureOpenAI:ApiKey\u0026quot;]; var apiKeyCredential = new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey);\nThis can then be used instead of the DefaultAzureCredential, and would be useful if you needed to run your application from somewhere that you can't use managed identities. System prompt and chat history Finally for this tutorial, you probably want to be able to have a full conversation with the model, and might want to also change the \u0026quot;system\u0026quot; prompt, which allows you to give instructions to your model about what it is intended to do and how it should respond to questions. This is achieved by building up a collection of ChatMessage objects, which includes the system prompt, along with all of the user's messages, but also should include the response objects generated by the model itself as they form an important part of the context of the ongoing conversation. Here we're initializing a list of chat history messages with a system prompt. List chatHistory = new() { new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; You are an enthusiastic Arsenal supporter. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) };\nAnd now, in a loop, we create a new ChatRole.User message from the user's console input, and pass the whole thing into CompleteStreamingAsync which allows us to print the output from the model as it returns. This improves the perceived responsiveness, as the user can start reading the model's response while it is still being generated. Finally, before looping round again, we put the whole response into the chat history list as a ChatRole.Assistant message. while (true) { // Get user prompt and add to chat history Console.WriteLine(\u0026quot;Your prompt:\u0026quot;); var userPrompt = Console.ReadLine(); chatHistory.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, userPrompt));\n// Stream the AI response and add to chat history Console.WriteLine(\u0026quot;AI Response:\u0026quot;); var response = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; await foreach (var item in chatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync(chatHistory)) { Console.Write(item.Text); response += item.Text; } chatHistory.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, response)); Console.WriteLine(); }\nIf we test this out, we can see that it does indeed take into account the system prompt.\nYour prompt: Who is the greatest striker? AI response: As an Arsenal supporter, I have to give a special nod to Thierry Henry when discussing the greatest strikers! His combination of skill, pace, and goal-scoring ability made him a legend at the club. With over 200 goals for Arsenal and numerous accolades, including two Premier League titles and a stint as the club's all-time leading scorer, he undoubtedly left an indelible mark on both Arsenal and the Premier League as a whole. However, opinions may vary, and players like Pele, Diego Maradona, and more recently Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo often come up in the conversation as well. But for me, Henry will always be the greatest! What do you think?\nSummary Obviously these are just the first steps to programmatically calling an AI model in C#, but the great thing about Microsoft.AI.Extensions is that it is designed to integrate with many different AI services, including using OpenAI's own API, or running a local model. At the moment there doesn't seem to be support for some of the other major AI models such as Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini but I expect that will come in due course. I've been experimenting with a few more features of the library as well, so hoping to be able to share some other findings soon. I'd love to hear in the comments what you've built using APIs for AI services.\nLink to article: https://markheath.net/post/getting-started-ai-extensions ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/04_01_2025/04_01_2025_0/","section":"post","tags":["markheath.net"],"title":"Calling Azure OpenAI models from C# with Microsoft.Extensions.AI"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/tags/markheath.net/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Markheath.net"},{"body":"Drawing from years of experience, I share my battle-tested approach to unit testing Clean Architecture use cases in .NET, focusing on the critical balance between code coverage and test quality.

Availability and pricing When the year began the availability of these tools was mostly limited to paying customers, but with the majority of LLMs now offering completely free tiers that are perfectly capable of generating code, and now tools like GitHub Copilot (also now offering a free tier) that integrate directly with your IDE, it seems inevitable that in 2025 it will become an integral part of the way most developers write code. Trust issues Another barrier to adoption was whether it was safe to use the code it generates. How can I trust that it has not been trained on does not use a license that is not-compliant? How can I be sure that there aren't subtle security vulnerabilities? And assuming the code compiles, does it actually work correctly? It feels like some good progress has been made on these fronts this year. Tools like GitHub Copilot can scan the generated code to ensure it complies with open source licenses and avoids infringing on copyrights. And many companies are already integrating vulnerability scanning tools directly into their development process. As for the correctness of the generated code, many developers I spoke to at the start of the year expressed the intention that they would manually code review all LLM-generated code to scrutinize it for errors. However, the speed and simplicity of code generation means that already we are seeing people skip this step and jump directly to compiling and running the code. Learn to use it effectively There are of course still many coding tasks that LLMs are not good at. Either they fail to understand the requirements, or they are unaware of the intricacies of the APIs needed to correctly fulfil the task. Or you've simply asked it to do something too complicated for a single prompt. I think one of the most valuable skills for developers to learn in 2025 will be how to more effectively prompt LLMs to help solving coding tasks. It's essential to not only have a good grasp of what they are capable of, but how to guide them to do exactly what you want. This often includes going back several times and asking it to fix its previous answer rather than simply giving up if the initially generated code is not working. I'll briefly share a few simple examples of the places I've found LLMs have accelerated my development in the last year. Help with second-language C# is my primary coding language, and so I often don't feel the need to ask LLMs for help with that. But I often find myself needing to use various scripting languages that I am less fluent in. For example, recently I needed to write a PowerShell script that took an MP4 file, ran it through FFMPEG to convert it to a different format, and then calculated the SHA256 hash of the output file. It's not super-complicated, but would normally require me to do a bunch of web searches to remember the various bits of PowerShell syntax, FFMPEG command line flags and powershell hashing capabilities needed to complete that task. ChatGPT was able to correctly generate the script on the first attempt. Another example is SQL. I can write simple queries, but if I want a quick script to check if a row exists and create it if it doesn't, LLMs can write it more quickly than I can. It recently surprised my by managing to perfectly generate the SQL to create all of the ASP.NET Core Identity tables. Automate everything I'm also often spinning up resources in Azure for test purposes. Although I am very capable of using the Azure CLI to script out creating App Service Plans, SQL database etc, it still takes longer to write out by hand than doing things in the portal. But now I can just ask an LLM to make me a script using the Azure CLI to automate the creation of the resources I need in a fraction of the time. I'm hoping that this will mean I can start to automate almost everything, rather than being lazy and doing some things manually. Small, focused tasks One of the most crucial skills a software developer (or architect) needs is the ability to use \u0026quot;divide and conquer\u0026quot;. That is, to take a large problem and break it up into manageable chunks that can be solved individually. And it turns out that this skill is also very useful for getting good results from LLMs. For example, I might first an LLM first to write the code that connects me using managed identities to an Azure Blob Storage account, and then a separate request to implement a chunked upload of a large file. I've found that by breaking things up into smaller tasks, the generated code has a higher chance of being right first time, and if it isn't, its a lot easier to fix up with follow-on requests. Code generation in 2025 It should be obvious to anyone who is paying attention that LLM generated code is not a fad. We're seeing rapid improvements not only to the quality of the code generated, but to the integration with tooling, and if you throw in the concept of \u0026quot;agents\u0026quot; to the mix that are able to automate the process of tackling much larger and more complex projects, this coming year could see even more dramatic shifts to the way we approach software development. Let me know in the comments what the most impressive thing you've used LLMs for is this year, and how you hope to use it in the coming year.
