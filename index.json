AWS Landing Zone addresses this need by offering a standardized approach to deploying AWS resources. This makes sure your cloud foundation is built according to AWS best practices from the start. With AWS Landing Zone, you eliminate the guesswork in security configurations, resource provisioning, and account management. It’s particularly beneficial for organizations looking to scale without compromising on governance or control, providing a clear path to a robust and efficient cloud setup. In this post, we show you how to generate customized, compliant IaC scripts for AWS Landing Zone using Amazon Bedrock.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/generate-customized-compliant-application-iac-scripts-for-aws-landing-zone-using-amazon-bedrock/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/18_04_2024/18_04_2024_0/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Generate customized, compliant application IaC scripts for AWS Landing Zone using Amazon Bedrock"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"You’ve likely experienced the challenge of taking notes during a meeting while trying to pay attention to the conversation. You’ve probably also experienced the need to quickly fact-check something that’s been said, or look up information to answer a question that’s just been asked in the call. Or maybe you have a team member that always joins meetings late, and expects you to send them a quick summary over chat to catch them up. Then there are the times that others are talking in a language that’s not your first language, and you’d love to have a live translation of what people are saying to make sure you understand correctly. And after the call is over, you usually want to capture a summary for your records, or to send to the participants, with a list of all the action items, owners, and due dates.
