The model we chose to use was gpt-4o-mini, which has the advantage of being \u0026quot;multimodal\u0026quot;, as it can accept not only text input, but images as well. In this post I'll show how you can pass an image to this model using Microsoft.Extensions.AI and ask it to describe the image. It's relatively straightforward, but as always seems to be the case with these things, there was a gotcha I ran into. Adding a local image to a ChatMessage To pass in an image, you still create an instance of ChatMessage in the same way you do with text conversations, and you can add a text prompt as well. But then you can add the binary contents of an image file to the ChatMessage by appending an ImageContent object to the message contents. var message = new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, \u0026quot;Can you provide a brief, one-sentence description of this image.\u0026quot;); var data = File.ReadAllBytes(@\u0026quot;C:\\temp\\example.jpeg\u0026quot;); message.Contents.Add(new ImageContent(data, \u0026quot;image/jpeg\u0026quot;));\nAdding an online image to a ChatMessage If instead your image is online, you still use ImageContent, but point to a URL instead... message.Contents.Add( new ImageContent(new Uri(\u0026quot;https://example.net/image.jpg\u0026quot;)));\nSubmitting the message and testing it Submitting the chat message follows the same pattern demonstrated in my previous post. We add the ChatMessage to our history, and then use CompleteStreamingAsync to print the response as it is generated. chatHistory.Add(message);\nawait foreach (var item in chatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync(chatHistory)) { Console.Write(item.Text); }\nIf all is configured correctly, then you'll get a response describing the image you submitted. I was very impressed with the small number of \u0026quot;tokens\u0026quot; required to pass the image in. My test photograph added only 70 tokens - the equivalent of a couple of paragraphs of text.\nA band is performing on stage, featuring instruments like electric guitars, drums, and a keyboard, with a colorful patterned backdrop behind them.\nPotential gotcha - rate limiting Unfortunately, when I initially tested this, it simply didn't work at all. I got no response from the model - it just hung. Eventually the root cause became apparent when I tried using the \u0026quot;chat playground\u0026quot; available at ai.azure.com. This told me that I was being rate limited. That was surprising as the default rate limit for a model is 10,000 tokens per minute, and 100 requests per minute, which I'm pretty sure I wasn't over. However, upping my limit to 40,000 tokens per minute in the Azure portal for my deployment enabled everything to start working again. Hopefully the library will be improved to be able to report if you are being rate-limited in the future. Summary The Microsoft.Extensions.AI package makes it very easy to attach an image to a chat message. And I recommend using ai.azure.com to test out your chats if you run into problems using these models programmatically.\nLink to article: https://markheath.net/post/passing-image-content ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/07_01_2025/07_01_2025_16/","section":"post","tags":["markheath.net"],"title":"Passing images to LLMs in C# with Microsoft.Extensions.AI"},{"body":"In this post, we walk you through the process to build an automated mechanism using Amazon SageMaker to process your log data, run training iterations over it to obtain the best-performing anomaly detection model, and register it with the Amazon SageMaker Model Registry for your customers to use it.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/efficiently-build-and-tune-custom-log-anomaly-detection-models-with-amazon-sagemaker/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/06_01_2025/06_01_2025_0/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Efficiently build and tune custom log anomaly detection models with Amazon SageMaker"},{"body":"In this episode of Scott and Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich dive into the topic of hobbies and how they ...\nLink to article: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypcog_lv0DA ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/videos/06_01_2025/06_01_2025_0/","section":"videos","tags":["youtube.com/@shanselman"],"title":"Scott \u0026amp; Mark Learn To...

You have a lot of choices around which models to use and how best to interact with them. In this post I want to go through the steps to implement a basic chat with an LLM hosted in Azure using C#, by taking advantage of the new Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package, which aims to simplify the process. There's a helpful tutorial available here, but there were a few permissions-related issues I ran into along the way, so I thought I'd document how I got it working myself. Step 1 - Create an Azure Open AI Model Deployment To start with, we need to create an AI model \u0026quot;deployment\u0026quot; in Azure. This can be done fairly simply in the Azure portal. First, create an \u0026quot;Azure OpenAI Service\u0026quot; resource, and then within it, you need to create a model \u0026quot;deployment\u0026quot;. This is one of the first points where it gets a bit confusing as there are several models to choose from and its not at all obvious if you are new to AI how to decide which one is the most appropriate. Essentially you're trading off cost, performance and capabilities, and for this tutorial, gpt-4o-mini would be a good choice. You'll need to take note of the Open AI service endpoint, which will be something like https://my-openai.openai.azure.com/, as well as the name of your deployment, e.g. \u0026quot;my-gpt-4o-mini\u0026quot;. Step 2 - Grant yourself the necessary permissions to use the model If you want to use EntraID for authenticating, then you'll need to grant yourself the necessary permissions to use the model deployment. This can be done by visiting the \u0026quot;Access control (IAM)\u0026quot; section of the portal for the OpenAI service and adding a role assignment of Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor to your user (I originally tried the \u0026quot;Cognitive Services OpenAI User\u0026quot; role but that didn't seem to be enough although I'm not sure why not). Step 3 - Call the model from C# In a C# console app, add references to the latest versions of the following packages: And then to actually connect to our Azure OpenAI service we can use DefaultAzureCredential. I find I often need to explicitly specify which tenant my resources are in, so I've shown how to do that with DefaultAzureCredentialOptions. You may also need to log into Azure with the Azure CLI using az login before this credential will work for you. var endpoint = \u0026quot;https://my-openai.openai.azure.com/\u0026quot;; var modelId = \u0026quot;my-gpt-4o-mini\u0026quot;; // this is the deployment name var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions() {\nTenantId = \u0026quot;123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\u0026quot; }); IChatClient client = new AzureOpenAIClient( new Uri(endpoint), credential) .AsChatClient(modelId);\nAnd now submitting a question to the chat client is very straightforward: var response = await client.CompleteAsync(\u0026quot;Should I learn about AI in 2025?\u0026quot;); Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\nI'll leave you to guess what the AI said in response! Using key-based authentication If you'd prefer to use key-based authentication, then you can access the key for your OpenAI service from the Azure portal. Dotnet secrets would be a good way to make your key available for local development, which you can set up by running the following commands in your project folder. dotnet user-secrets init dotnet user-secrets set \u0026quot;AzureOpenAI:ApiKey\u0026quot; \u0026quot;your-api-key-here\u0026quot; dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables\nAnd then in your Program.cs file, you can get the secret from configuration and construct an ApiKeyCredential with it. var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddUserSecrets() .AddEnvironmentVariables(); var configuration = builder.Build(); var apiKey = configuration[\u0026quot;AzureOpenAI:ApiKey\u0026quot;]; var apiKeyCredential = new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey);\nThis can then be used instead of the DefaultAzureCredential, and would be useful if you needed to run your application from somewhere that you can't use managed identities. System prompt and chat history Finally for this tutorial, you probably want to be able to have a full conversation with the model, and might want to also change the \u0026quot;system\u0026quot; prompt, which allows you to give instructions to your model about what it is intended to do and how it should respond to questions. This is achieved by building up a collection of ChatMessage objects, which includes the system prompt, along with all of the user's messages, but also should include the response objects generated by the model itself as they form an important part of the context of the ongoing conversation. Here we're initializing a list of chat history messages with a system prompt. List chatHistory = new() { new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; You are an enthusiastic Arsenal supporter. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) };\nAnd now, in a loop, we create a new ChatRole.User message from the user's console input, and pass the whole thing into CompleteStreamingAsync which allows us to print the output from the model as it returns. This improves the perceived responsiveness, as the user can start reading the model's response while it is still being generated. Finally, before looping round again, we put the whole response into the chat history list as a ChatRole.Assistant message. while (true) { // Get user prompt and add to chat history Console.WriteLine(\u0026quot;Your prompt:\u0026quot;); var userPrompt = Console.ReadLine(); chatHistory.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, userPrompt));\n// Stream the AI response and add to chat history Console.WriteLine(\u0026quot;AI Response:\u0026quot;); var response = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; await foreach (var item in chatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync(chatHistory)) { Console.Write(item.Text); response += item.Text; } chatHistory.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, response)); Console.WriteLine(); }\nIf we test this out, we can see that it does indeed take into account the system prompt.\nYour prompt: Who is the greatest striker? AI response: As an Arsenal supporter, I have to give a special nod to Thierry Henry when discussing the greatest strikers! His combination of skill, pace, and goal-scoring ability made him a legend at the club. With over 200 goals for Arsenal and numerous accolades, including two Premier League titles and a stint as the club's all-time leading scorer, he undoubtedly left an indelible mark on both Arsenal and the Premier League as a whole. However, opinions may vary, and players like Pele, Diego Maradona, and more recently Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo often come up in the conversation as well. But for me, Henry will always be the greatest! What do you think?\nSummary Obviously these are just the first steps to programmatically calling an AI model in C#, but the great thing about Microsoft.AI.Extensions is that it is designed to integrate with many different AI services, including using OpenAI's own API, or running a local model. At the moment there doesn't seem to be support for some of the other major AI models such as Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini but I expect that will come in due course. I've been experimenting with a few more features of the library as well, so hoping to be able to share some other findings soon. I'd love to hear in the comments what you've built using APIs for AI services.\nLink to article: https://markheath.net/post/getting-started-ai-extensions ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/04_01_2025/04_01_2025_0/","section":"post","tags":["markheath.net"],"title":"Calling Azure OpenAI models from C# with Microsoft.Extensions.AI"},{"body":"Drawing from years of experience, I share my battle-tested approach to unit testing Clean Architecture use cases in .NET, focusing on the critical balance between code coverage and test quality.
