Blazor’s component model is more than up to the task and you spend a few weeks happily building out UI to meet your requirements. But then you run into a requirement to integrate with a JavaScript library. Curse it! Now you have to figure out how to make calls to a JavaScript library from your Blazor app. This is exactly the kind of requirement that can get complicated, pretty quickly. Especially if the JS dependency is packaged up as a JavaScript module. Thankfully, importing JS modules into your Blazor app has become easier with recent releases, and .NET 9 addresses one of the biggest challenges. Say we have a small JS module for showing a ’toast’ notification. // JS/toast.js\nexport class NotificationHelper { async showToast(message, type = 'info', options = {}) { // details omitted } }\nexport default new NotificationHelper(); In your Blazor component, if you’re using Blazor WASM or Blazor Server, you can import this module and invoke its methods like this: @inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime;\n\u0026lt;button @onclick=\u0026quot;@(()=\u0026gt;ShowNotification(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;))\u0026quot;\u0026gt; Show Notification @code {\nasync Task ShowNotification(string message) { var module = await JSRuntime.InvokeAsync (\u0026quot;import\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;./js/toast.js\u0026quot;);\nawait module.InvokeVoidAsync( \u0026quot;default.showToast\u0026quot;, message, \u0026quot;success\u0026quot;); }\n} When a user clicks the button this will:\nLoad the contents of toast.js and import it as a JS module. invoke the showToast method on the default export from that JS module (NotificationHelper)\nBut what if you make changes to that JS script and re-deploy your app. Just as we saw last time with stylesheets, the browser will try to cache the JS module and your users will likely find themselves stuck with an old version. Cue chaos and confusion! Thankfully .NET 9 has a solution. When you switch to the new static asset middleware: app.MapStaticAssets(); You can also add something called ImportMap to your App.razor page.\nRun this in the browser, view the page source, and you’ll see that Blazor has identified all the JS modules in your app, and created an import map for them. When you publish your app .NET 9 creates a fingerprinted version of your JS modules, with a unique filename based on their contents. ./js/toast.voa2fr9sx9.js in this example. The import map then ensures any attempt to import these modules is redirected to the fingerprinted version. You can see this in the browser dev tools (assuming the component is running via Blazor WASM). Note how the request for the JS file is using the fingerprinted filename. With this your users will always get the latest version. Oh, and its worth noting the new static asset middleware compresses these resources by default too, so the browser gets to download significantly smaller JS and CSS files. – Jon\nLink to article: https://jonhilton.net/import-js-modules/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/13_11_2024/13_11_2024_25/","section":"post","tags":["jonhilton.net"],"title":".NET 9 improves JavaScript module importing for Blazor"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/tags/jonhilton.net/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Jonhilton.net"},{"body":"Discover Fidelity's latest innovation in trading technology with Active Trader Pro, built on Microsoft's .NET MAUI platform.\nLink to article: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOEU9tupQPw ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/videos/12_11_2024/12_11_2024_0/","section":"videos","tags":["youtube.com/@dotnet"],"title":"Fidelity’s New Active Trader Pro: Powered by .NET MAUI for Cross-Platform Excellence"},{"body":"Discover how a small team of five developers at Microsoft transformed the Copilot backend in just four months using .NET \u0026amp; .\nLink to article: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hFes7LI0Fk ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/videos/12_11_2024/12_11_2024_1/","section":"videos","tags":["youtube.com/@dotnet"],"title":"How Microsoft\u0026#39;s Copilot Team Rebuilt Their Backend with .NET \u0026amp; .NET Aspire"},{"body":"This session is led by a Gold Milestone Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador.

Modern browsers love to cache static assets like stylesheets. It speeds up performance and saves re-fetching the same thing multiple times from the server. The problem comes when you make changes to the stylesheet and push out a new version. Unless you change the filename of the stylesheet, the browser sees that your site is requesting a file it’s already cached and diligently serves the contents from the cache. One low-tech way to manage is to change the filename every time your publish your app. One common technique is to append a “fake” querystring value to the filename.\nThis works, but requires you to manually tweak this version for every deploy (easily forgotten in the rush to get a new deployment out the door). It also falls apart when you have a team working on the app, with multiple developers trying to make sure their version is picked up. .NET 9 solves this problem with its new and improved static asset handling. Here’s how it works. First you need to configure your app to use the new static file handling middleware. Program.cs // remove the old call to use static assets // app.UseStaticFiles(); // add this app.MapStaticAssets(); By itself this won’t do much so the next step is to update your stylesheet references, typically in App.razor.
