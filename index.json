Thousands of companies worldwide use Salesforce to manage their sales, marketing, customer service, and other business operations. The Salesforce cloud-based platform centralizes customer information and interactions across the organization, providing sales reps, marketers, and support agents with a unified 360-degree view of each customer. With Salesforce at the heart of their business, companies accumulate vast amounts of customer data within the platform over time. This data is incredibly valuable for gaining insights into customers, improving operations, and guiding strategic decisions. However, accessing and analyzing the blend of structured data and unstructured data can be challenging. With the Amazon Q Salesforce Online connector, companies can unleash the value of their Salesforce data.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/unleash-your-salesforce-data-using-the-amazon-q-salesforce-online-connector/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/26_11_2024/26_11_2024_0/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Unleash your Salesforce data using the Amazon Q Salesforce Online connector"},{"body":"This post demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Knowledge Bases, and the RAGAS evaluation metrics to build a custom hallucination detector and remediate it by using human-in-the-loop.
