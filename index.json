First, we introduce a context message strategy that maintains continuous communication between servers and clients during extended operations. Next, we develop an asynchronous task management framework that allows your AI agents to initiate long-running processes without blocking other operations. Finally, we demonstrate how to bring these strategies together with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Strands Agents to build production-ready AI agents that can handle complex, time-intensive operations reliably.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-long-running-mcp-servers-on-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-with-strands-agents-integration/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/12_02_2026/12_02_2026_3/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Build long-running MCP servers on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore with Strands Agents integration"},{"body":"Participa en VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day — Edición LATAM, el 2 de marzo, para aprender en la práctica cómo usar IA en ...\nLink to article: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVM4PrL44as ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/videos/12_02_2026/12_02_2026_4/","section":"videos","tags":["developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor"],"title":"VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day LATAM"},{"body":"Participe do VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day — Edição Brasil, no dia 2 de março, para aprender na prática como usar IA no ...\nLink to article: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3jjjwd_z4 ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/videos/12_02_2026/12_02_2026_5/","section":"videos","tags":["developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor"],"title":"VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day Brasil"},{"body":"Introduction The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) has undergone some important changes in how it handles Entra ID app registration and security models.
