LLMs are a type of foundation model (FM) that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This post discusses how LLMs can be accessed through Amazon Bedrock to build a generative AI solution that automatically summarizes key information, recognizes the customer sentiment, and generates actionable insights from customer reviews. This method shows significant promise in saving human analysts time while producing high-quality results. We examine the approach in detail, provide examples, highlight key benefits and limitations, and discuss future opportunities for more advanced product review summarization through generative AI.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-customer-reviews-using-amazon-bedrock/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/21_08_2024/21_08_2024_1/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Analyze customer reviews using Amazon Bedrock"},{"body":"","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/tags/aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Aws.amazon.com/Blogs/Machine-Learning"},{"body":"Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions, are rapidly demonstrating their vast potential to revolutionize enterprise operations.
