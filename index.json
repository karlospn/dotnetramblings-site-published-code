We provide insights on interpretability, robustness, and best practices of architecting complex ML workflows on AWS with Amazon SageMaker. These multi-modal pipelines are being used on the Genomics England cancer cohort to enhance our understanding of cancer biomarkers and biology.\nLink to article: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/genomics-england-uses-amazon-sagemaker-to-predict-cancer-subtypes-and-patient-survival-from-multi-modal-data/ ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/11_09_2024/11_09_2024_17/","section":"post","tags":["aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning"],"title":"Genomics England uses Amazon SageMaker to predict cancer subtypes and patient survival from multi-modal data"},{"body":"This site is an automated news aggregator.
