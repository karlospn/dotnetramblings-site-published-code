Each AI provider will have its own pricing structure for the various models it offers. For example, here are pricing pages for Azure OpenAI service, OpenAI's own API, Anthropic's API, Google Gemini API, DeepSeek API, Amazon Bedrock, and xAI Grok. As you can see there is a huge choice available, but the pricing is always based on the number of \u0026quot;tokens\u0026quot; you use. Tokens Whenever you construct a chat message, the text (or image, etc) in your message is turned into a number of tokens representing your message. And if you're including the chat history, then those are additional tokens passed in as input, so if your chat goes on for a long time, each subsequent message will use more and more tokens. And then the response from the AI model also uses a number of tokens. So if you only need a short answer to reduce costs, your system prompt should probably say that. In previous posts I showed how you could create a List and pass that to IChatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync to receive the response from the model and display it as it is generated. But how can you keep track of how many tokens you are using? The Microsoft.Extensions.AI package exposes a UsageDetails object that can be got hold of very easily if you use CompleteAsync as that returns a ChatCompletion which has a usage property. Getting UsageDetails from CompleteStreamingAsync Things are slightly more complicated when calling CompleteStreamingAsync, as that returns a series of StreamingChatCompletionUpdate objects. Typically the final one of these will have an instance of UsageContent in its Contents property. In the following code example, I show how to get hold of this UsageContent so it can be printed out once the chat client's response has been received: async Task GetResponse(IChatClient chatClient, List chatHistory) { Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot;AI Response started at {DateTime.Now}:\u0026quot;); var response = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; UsageDetails? usageDetails = null; await foreach (var item in chatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync(chatHistory)) { Console.Write(item.Text); response += item.Text;\nvar usage = item.Contents.OfType\u0026lt;UsageContent\u0026gt;() .FirstOrDefault()?.Details; if (usage != null) usageDetails = usage; } Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot;\\nAI Response completed at {DateTime.Now}:\u0026quot;); ShowUsageDetails(usageDetails); return new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, response); }\nExploring UsageDetails UsageDetails includes properties for input and output token counts (along with the total), as well as an optional additional properties dictionary (which itself may contain further dictionaries), allowing different AI providers to include additional metadata that can help you understand pricing. For the Azure OpenAI service, this included a ReasoningTokenCount which was 0 in my tests using the gpt-4o-mini model, but the o1 and o1-mini models can be told how many \u0026quot;reasoning tokens\u0026quot; they are allowed to use for a particular request, so you might increase that for a particularly tricky problem. Here's my code to display the contents of the UsageDetails object: void ShowUsageDetails(UsageDetails? usage) { if (usage != null) { Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot; InputTokenCount: {usage.InputTokenCount}\u0026quot;); Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot; OutputTokenCount: {usage.OutputTokenCount}\u0026quot;); Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot; TotalTokenCount: {usage.TotalTokenCount}\u0026quot;); if (usage.AdditionalProperties != null) { ShowNestedDictionary(usage.AdditionalProperties!, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;); } } }\nvoid ShowNestedDictionary(IDictionary\u0026lt;string, object\u0026gt; dictionary, string indent) { foreach (var (key, value) in dictionary) { if (value is IDictionary\u0026lt;string, object\u0026gt; nestedDictionary) { Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot;{indent}{key}:\u0026quot;); ShowNestedDictionary(nestedDictionary, indent + \u0026quot; \u0026quot;); } else { Console.WriteLine($\u0026quot;{indent}{key}: {value}\u0026quot;); } } }\nTesting it out Let's run a query through this code and see how many tokens we use. To keep costs to a minimum I'll guide the AI to give me a one word answer (with an extra hint just to make sure it gives me a good answer)! Your prompt: Who will win the world cup? 1 word answer. Must start with \u0026quot;E\u0026quot; AI Response started at 11/01/2025 16:52:05: England. AI Response completed at 11/01/2025 16:52:06: InputTokenCount: 43 OutputTokenCount: 2 TotalTokenCount: 45 OutputTokenDetails: ReasoningTokenCount: 0\nSummary If you're planning to use an AI model in production, then its really important for you to keep track of cost. You want to minimize the number of tokens you use, and avoid the more expensive models if cheaper ones are capable of doing what you need. The UsageDetails capability of Microsoft.Extensions.AI allows you to know exactly how many tokens each of your interactions with the model used.\nLink to article: https://markheath.net/post/tracking-token-usage-microsoft-extensions-ai ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/11_01_2025/11_01_2025_1/","section":"post","tags":["markheath.net"],"title":"Tracking Token Usage with Microsoft.Extensions.AI"},{"body":"Microsoft.Extensions.AI provides a unified interface for integrating LLMs into .NET applications, allowing developers to switch between providers like Ollama, Azure, or OpenAI without changing application code.

The model we chose to use was gpt-4o-mini, which has the advantage of being \u0026quot;multimodal\u0026quot;, as it can accept not only text input, but images as well. In this post I'll show how you can pass an image to this model using Microsoft.Extensions.AI and ask it to describe the image. It's relatively straightforward, but as always seems to be the case with these things, there was a gotcha I ran into. Adding a local image to a ChatMessage To pass in an image, you still create an instance of ChatMessage in the same way you do with text conversations, and you can add a text prompt as well. But then you can add the binary contents of an image file to the ChatMessage by appending an ImageContent object to the message contents. var message = new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, \u0026quot;Can you provide a brief, one-sentence description of this image.\u0026quot;); var data = File.ReadAllBytes(@\u0026quot;C:\\temp\\example.jpeg\u0026quot;); message.Contents.Add(new ImageContent(data, \u0026quot;image/jpeg\u0026quot;));\nAdding an online image to a ChatMessage If instead your image is online, you still use ImageContent, but point to a URL instead... message.Contents.Add( new ImageContent(new Uri(\u0026quot;https://example.net/image.jpg\u0026quot;)));\nSubmitting the message and testing it Submitting the chat message follows the same pattern demonstrated in my previous post. We add the ChatMessage to our history, and then use CompleteStreamingAsync to print the response as it is generated. chatHistory.Add(message);\nawait foreach (var item in chatClient.CompleteStreamingAsync(chatHistory)) { Console.Write(item.Text); }\nIf all is configured correctly, then you'll get a response describing the image you submitted. I was very impressed with the small number of \u0026quot;tokens\u0026quot; required to pass the image in. My test photograph added only 70 tokens - the equivalent of a couple of paragraphs of text.\nA band is performing on stage, featuring instruments like electric guitars, drums, and a keyboard, with a colorful patterned backdrop behind them.\nPotential gotcha - rate limiting Unfortunately, when I initially tested this, it simply didn't work at all. I got no response from the model - it just hung. Eventually the root cause became apparent when I tried using the \u0026quot;chat playground\u0026quot; available at ai.azure.com. This told me that I was being rate limited. That was surprising as the default rate limit for a model is 10,000 tokens per minute, and 100 requests per minute, which I'm pretty sure I wasn't over. However, upping my limit to 40,000 tokens per minute in the Azure portal for my deployment enabled everything to start working again. Hopefully the library will be improved to be able to report if you are being rate-limited in the future. Summary The Microsoft.Extensions.AI package makes it very easy to attach an image to a chat message. And I recommend using ai.azure.com to test out your chats if you run into problems using these models programmatically.\nLink to article: https://markheath.net/post/passing-image-content ","link":"https://www.dotnetramblings.com/post/07_01_2025/07_01_2025_16/","section":"post","tags":["markheath.net"],"title":"Passing images to LLMs in C# with Microsoft.Extensions.AI"},{"body":"This site is an automated news aggregator.
