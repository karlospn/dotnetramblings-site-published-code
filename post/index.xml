            本文翻译自微软首席产品经理Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi的dotnet scaffold – Next Generation Content Creation for .NET 。 在Visual Studio中，用于ASP.NET Core项目的Scaffolding是一个已经存在很久的功能，它在ASP.NET Core发布之后不久就已经添加。我们多年来也一直支持从命令行里进行Scaffolding。从命令行的使用体验中，我们听到了许多用户的反馈，他们希望我们为Scaffolding提供一个交互式的命令行界面 (CLI)。为此目标，我们一直在开发一个新的交互式CLI工具 dotnet scaffold。这个工具现在已经做为预览版发布。在这边文章中，我们将描述如果获取和使用这个新的命令行工具。此工具是开源的，您可以在scaffolding存储库 中查看代码。该存储库包含了 dotnet scaffold 工具的代码以及其他scaffolding相关的代码。 安装dotnet scaffold 我们将使用 dotnet tool 命令来安装此工具。您可以执行以下的命令来安装最新发布的版本： dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.dotnet-scaffold 如需安装特定的版本，请访问nuget.org上的软件包。有关如果管理dotnet工具的更多信息，请参阅 .NET 工具 – .NET CLI | Microsoft Learn 上的文档。在上面的命令中，我们正在全局安装该工具，但是您也可以将工具安装到本地文件夹中。.NET 工具的文档中包含了有关这两种方法的更多信息 .NET 工具 – .NET CLI | Microsoft Learn。 使用dotnet scaffold […]

            In Part 1 of this series, we introduced the newly launched ModelTrainer class on the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK and its benefits, and showed you how to fine-tune a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model on a custom dataset. In this post, we look at the enhancements to the ModelBuilder class, which lets you seamlessly deploy a model from ModelTrainer to a SageMaker endpoint, and provides a single interface for multiple deployment configurations.

            In this post, we illustrate the importance of generative AI in the collaboration between Tealium and the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) team by automating the following: 1/ Evaluating the retriever and the generated answer of a RAG system based on the Ragas Repository powered by Amazon Bedrock, 2/ Generating improved instructions for each question-and-answer pair using an automatic prompt engineering technique based on the Auto-Instruct Repository. An instruction refers to a general direction or command given to the model to guide generation of a response.

            Introduction In modern distributed .NET applications, managing context across execution boundaries is a critical architectural concern. While both AsyncLocal and ThreadLocal provide mechanisms for maintaining contextual data, their implementations and use cases differ significantly in ways that impact system architecture, performance, and maintainability.

            Benchmarking is essential in application development, especially if you aim to scale up your app. Benchmarking enables you to evaluate your application&#39;s resource consumption, which helps you identify potential updates to speed up performance. If not scaling, you will need the application performance to be optimal to enhance

            Understanding where a dependency comes from can be tedious. This is especially true when you have a large project with many dependencies. Recently, .NET brings a new tool dotnet nuget why to help you understand why a package is installed in your project. However, there is a better way to do it, and it doesn&#39;t requires a recent SDK. dotnet nuget why can explain why a package is included in your project:…
