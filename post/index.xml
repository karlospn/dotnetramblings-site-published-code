            GitHub Copilot code completions are autocomplete-stye suggestions that appear inline as you code. Until today, they have used context from your active file and other tabs open in the editor to inform the suggestion that is returned. However, we know that more contextually relevant input leads to better suggestions.

            By default, PowerShell doesn&#39;t stop the script when an error occurs. Instead, it writes the error to the error stream and continues executing the script.

            Choosing the right database solution is critical for the performance and scalability of your applications. When working with NoSQL, Table data and Microsoft Azure, two prominent options for table storage are Azure Cosmos DB for Table and Azure Table Storage (aka Azure Storage Tables). Both services provide robust solutions for storing semi-structured table data, but […] The article How to Choose Between Azure Cosmos DB for Table and Azure Table Storage was originally published on Build5Nines.

It can run a security audit with the dotnet restore command, which checks your dependencies against a list of known vulnerabilities from the GitHub Advisory Database. If vulnerabilities are found, you can update the affected packages…
