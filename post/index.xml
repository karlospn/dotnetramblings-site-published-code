            Most modern applications require the historical audit logging of changes made to database entities. The audit log provides you with insights into all changes made, including their timestamps and the users responsible for those changes. The logs ensure transparency, allowing stakeholders to observe what changes were made to business-critical data,

            In this post, we&#39;ll look at Amazon Bedrock pricing through the lens of a practical, real-world example: building a customer service chatbot. We&#39;ll break down the essential cost components, walk through capacity planning for a mid-sized call center implementation, and provide detailed pricing calculations across different foundation models.

            There’s a weird contradiction in modern AI development. We have better tools than ever. We’re building smarter systems with cleaner abstractions. And yet, every time you try to swap out a component in your stack, things fall apart. Again. This isn’t just an inconvenience. It’s become the norm. You’d think with all the frameworks and...

            The DateTimeFormat type in Spargine simplifies date and time formatting for .NET developers. It provides a strongly typed set of options, reducing the need to memorize format strings. Available through the DotNetTips.Spargine.Extensions project, it streamlines formatting using the ToFormattedString() extension method for efficient coding.

            Five REST API design mistakes I see all the time, with practical fixes. Use consistent resource naming, evolve contracts instead of bumping versions, add envelopes, pagination and filtering, return Problem Details, and bake in auth, authz, and rate limits from day one.

            Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance costs typically range from $450,000 to over $2 million and take 12 to 18 months to achieve, time your competitors are using to capture government contracts. While you’re spending months configuring FIPS cryptography, hardening security baselines, and navigating 400+ security controls, your competitors are already shipping to...

            A customer was developing a service, and they didn&#39;t want users to be able to change the service&#39;s startup type (e.g. change it from auto-start to disabled). They saw that other services had the &amp;quot;Startup type&amp;quot; field disabled. How can they get in on that action? They found that that they could get close to the desired behavior by restricting

            We launched Docker Hardened Images (DHI) in May, and in just two and a half months, adoption has accelerated rapidly across industries. From nimble startups to global enterprises, organizations are turning to DHI to achieve near-zero CVEs, shrink their attack surface, and harden their software supply chain, all without slowing down developers. In a short...

            You’ve seen it before. Someone says, “It works on my machine,” and suddenly you’re deep in a rabbit hole trying to understand why a project that works perfectly on one machine fails to build or test on another. That’s configuration drift – when a developer’s actual environment starts to deviate from the project’s intended configuration. […]

            Windows issues monthly updates, but the bigger updates happen twice a year. The one that happens in the first half of the year is called the H1 release, and the one in the second half is the H2 release. The letter H refers to &amp;quot;half&amp;quot;, which is the same pattern used by finance people to refer to the first and second halves of fiscal years. (Q

            Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core is one of those features you often just set and forget. Unless you realize that your error log is awfully quiet, applications with failing or misconfigured exception handling can cause severe problems for your end users. In this post, I&#39;ll show

            In this post, we demonstrate how to track and analyze multi-tenant model inference costs on Amazon Bedrock using the Converse API&#39;s requestMetadata parameter. The solution includes an ETL pipeline using AWS Glue and Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize usage patterns, token consumption, and cost allocation across different tenants and departments.
