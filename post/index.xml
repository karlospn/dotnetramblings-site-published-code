            Introduction One of my favorite new features in .NET 10 is C# file-based apps (or file-based C# programs if you prefer). With this feature, we can create individual .cs files and then run them using dotnet run &amp;lt;file.cs&amp;gt;. On Unix OSes you can go even further and mark the files as executable and include a shebang (#!) directive as the first line to tell the OS what to run it with and then you can run the files directly without even calling dotnet run.

            Mobile security goes beyond verifying user identity. If an attacker steals a valid token, how will your backend distinguish a legitimate request from one reproduced in an emulator or cloned environment? This is a gap in traditional authentication flows when applied to the mobile environment. By linking each request to hardware-backed keys g

            Earlier this year, the TypeScript team announced that we&#39;ve been porting the compiler and language service to native code to take advantage of better raw performance, memory usage, and parallelism. This effort (codenamed &amp;quot;Project Corsa&amp;quot;, and soon &amp;quot;TypeScript 7.0&amp;quot;)

      <description>
        
          
            Introduction A command that many shells have had forever and that PowerShell has had for a long time as well is ‘cd -’ which means “change directory to previous folder”. This means you could do something like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6
cd c:\dev c:\dev cd c:\temp c:\temp cd - c:\dev
This is quite handy in many situations. In particular, since I’ve modified my PowerShell Profile to NOT start in my users folder but instead to start in my c:\dev folder (from which I can easily get to any repo I may be working from), I very often find myself using cd - whenever I create a new terminal in the folder I want to be in such as when using VS Code.

            Recall that Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but it&#39;s jargon that you need to know to survive at Microsoft. The term big rocks was introduced by Stephen Covey in the book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, which I suspect is very popular among senior executives, because senior execu

            Did you know? Calling GC.Collect() explicitly forces the garbage collector to run and reclaim memory from unreachable objects. However, it’s generally discouraged to use this method in most applications because the garbage collector is highly optimized to run automatically. Forcing it can lead to performance issues by interrupting the normal optimization process. Welcome to dotInsights […]

            In the explosive era of Agentic AI, we&#39;re not just seeking more powerful models—we&#39;re searching for a development experience that lets developers actually get some sleep. When building Agents locally, we&#39;ve traditionally faced three major challenges:

To set the focus, they did SetFocus(GetDlgItem(hDlg, initialCon

            Imagine you’re working on a project and jotting down every single idea, experiment, and failure. After a while, your notes pile up so high that finding what’s useful takes more time and energy than the work itself. A similar problem faces users of software engineering (SE) agents: the agents “take notes” on every generated output, […]

            Embeddings have become the backbone of many modern AI applications. From semantic search to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent recommendation systems, embedding models enable systems to understand the meaning behind text, code, or documents, not just the literal words. But generating embeddings comes with trade-offs. Using a hosted API for embedding generation often results in...

            The article emphasizes the importance of defensive programming in .NET applications by validating resource availability before access. It outlines guidelines for checking connectivity, setting timeouts, and managing user experiences when resources are unavailable. The author shares personal insights and promotes Spargine, an open-source project designed to enhance defensive programming practices.

            Deciding where shared logic lives is the most critical moment in Vertical Slice Architecture adoption, as choosing incorrectly reintroduces the coupling the architecture aims to eliminate. This article proposes a three-tier approach to sharing code that balances technical infrastructure, domain concepts, and local feature logic.

            Do you know who managed to cut costs by a staggering 90% by abandoning microservices for a monolith in May 2023? Not a cash-strapped startup or an indie project—Amazon itself, for its Prime Video service. The same AWS that earns billions every year by selling microservices infrastructure admitted that, sometimes, a good old monolith wins. ...

            A customer wanted to show a dialog box, but they didn&#39;t want it to be attached to any of their existing windows because it was a general dialog that applied to all of their windows. So they had a great idea: Their program already had a message-only window, so they figured, &amp;quot;Hey, I already have this garbage window I can use as the owner of s

            Imagine this: your application goes down in a major Azure region outage. DNS traffic shifts to the secondary region as designed. Terraform kicks off to scale the backup environment. Everything should just seamlessly work… but it doesn’t. Why? Because names don’t match. Storage accounts are globally unique. Key Vault names are different across regions. Resource […] The article Terraform + Azure Multi-Region Naming Convention across Azure Regions, Resources, and Terraform Modules was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we explore how Myriad Genetics partnered with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to transform their healthcare document processing pipeline using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova foundation models, achieving 98% classification accuracy while reducing costs by 77% and processing time by 80%. We detail the technical implementation using AWS&#39;s open-source GenAI Intelligent Document Processing Accelerator, the optimization strategies for document classification and key information extraction, and the measurable business impact on Myriad&#39;s prior authorization workflows.

            In this post, CBRE and AWS demonstrate how they transformed property management by building a unified search and digital assistant using Amazon Bedrock, enabling professionals to access millions of documents and multiple databases through natural language queries. The solution combines Amazon Nova Pro for SQL generation and Claude Haiku for document interactions, achieving a 67% reduction in processing time while maintaining enterprise-grade security across more than eight million documents.

            In this post, we introduce Managed Tiered KV Cache and Intelligent Routing for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, new capabilities that can reduce time to first token by up to 40% and lower compute costs by up to 25% for long context prompts and multi-turn conversations. These features automatically manage distributed KV caching infrastructure and intelligent request routing, making it easier to deploy production-scale LLM inference workloads with enterprise-grade performance while significantly reducing operational overhead.
