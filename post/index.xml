            In this article, we’ll look at source-generated RegEx and how it can improve performance in our .NET applications. Let’s dive in! How Does RegEx Work? Regular expressions are vital to the programming world, but do we know how they work in .NET? Let’s examine the example: public static class PasswordValidator { public static bool ValidatePasswordWithRegularRegEx(string […] The post Improve Performance With Source-Generated RegEx in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            Perhaps one of the largest differences between “Action RunCommand” (internally called RunCommand V1) and “Managed RunCommand” (internally called RunCommand V2) is that Managed RunCommands are ARM resources themselves. That means you can use them in ARM templates. Recently, I needed to issue a RunCommand in an ARM template,

            All resources within Microsoft Azure are created within an Azure Resource Group. While every resource has an Azure Region (aka location) specified as to where the resource will be hosted, so do Azure Resource Groups. This may be confusing at first, since Azure Resource Groups are a “global” resource. This means they are just an […] The article Why do Azure Resource Groups have an Azure Region association? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            In this two-part series, I’m going to show you how to build and deploy a .NET 8 app container image that targets an ARM64 processor. In part 2, we will attempt to perform an end-to-end process. This will involve building a .NET 8 API, containerizing the app targeting an ARM64 processor using Azure Pipelines, and deploying it on AWS ECS Fargate. Furthermore, a benchmark will also be conducted to compare the performance of the application running on an ARM64 Fargate container versus an AMD64 Fargate container.

            When working with Terraform, one common question that arises is whether to include the .terraform.lock.hcl file in the Git repository or leave it out by adding it to .gitignore. This decision impacts the version control practices and reproducibility of your infrastructure deployments. In this article, we’ll explore the contents of the .terraform.lock.hcl file, discuss why […] The article Should .terraform.lock.hcl file be added to .gitignore or committed to Git repo? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            This is a guest post co-written with Michael Feil at Gradient. Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) is an important step of the pre-training and fine-tuning process before deployment. The faster and more frequent you’re able to validate performance, the higher the chances you’ll be able to improve the performance of the model. […]

This means string objects are immutable and thus can’t be changed once created. Despite this, we often find ourselves needing to manipulate them.

            Large language models (LLMs) are generally trained on large publicly available datasets that are domain agnostic. For example, Meta’s Llama models are trained on datasets such as CommonCrawl, C4, Wikipedia, and ArXiv. These datasets encompass a broad range of topics and domains. Although the resulting models yield amazingly good results for general tasks, such as […]
