            Today, we’re excited to announce multi-turn conversation with an agent node (preview), a powerful new capability in Flows. This new capability enhances the agent node functionality, enabling dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue in a flow execution.

            Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a handy tool for database operations in .NET applications. It is also so powerful that you will find everything you can do conventionally in SQL queries with easy LINQ methods. Today, we will explore an essential feature of Efcore that may help you organize

            Whether during application startup, multi-step workflows, or monitoring an application’s overall health, verifying database connectivity is essential for smooth operation and graceful handling of potential failures. It improves reliability and the overall user experience. In modern containerized environments, often managed by orchestrators like Kubernetes (K8S), it’s equally important for services to report their health status. […] The post Testing Database Connectivity with EF Core appeared first on Code Maze.

For instance, you can create a console application that loads a solution, find patterns, and rewrite code. While Roslyn Analyzers are tied to a single project, you can use Roslyn as a library to analyze a whole solution. Let&#39;s create the console…

            In previous posts in this series I&#39;ve shown how to call LLMs with C# using the Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package. In this post I want to look at how you can enable the LLM to make calls into your own C# code by giving it &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; it can use. And we&#39;ll also discuss some of the security implications as this can open up a number of concerning attack vectors. There are a number of reasons you might want to give an LLM the ability to call a tool.
