            Picture this: I’m standing in front of 400+ developers at Visual Studio Live! Redmond, right here on the Microsoft campus in Building 33, about to reveal what I call the hidden value of a Visual Studio subscription. I pull up a simple question on the screen:

            Building AI agents shouldn&#39;t be rocket science. Yet many developers find themselves wrestling with complex orchestration logic, struggling to connect multiple AI models, or spending weeks building hosting infrastructure just to get a simple agent into production. What if building an AI agent could be as straightforward as creating a

            The traditional Win32 data structure for holding a date/time is the FILETIME. How do you interoperate between this and the C++ clocks like std::system_clock and winrt::clock? When C++ introduced the concept of clocks in C++11, it did not require clocks to have any particular epoch. In C++20, th

            Why agents need a new foundation Over the last year, developers have been experimenting with AI agents in every imaginable form. Agents are not just chatbots or copilots — they are autonomous software components that can reason about goals, call tools and APIs, collaborate with other agents, and adapt dynamically.

            ArrayPool optimizes memory usage by providing a thread-safe pool of reusable arrays, significantly reducing allocations and garbage collection pressure, especially in high-performance scenarios. It&#39;s effective for I/O, serialization, and media processing. Best practices include tight scope management, clearing sensitive data on return, and careful tracking of logical array lengths.

            To the best of my recollection and internet sleuthing today, development on Marten started in October of 2015 after my then colleague Corey Kaylor had kicked around an idea the previous summer to utilize the new JSONB feature in PostgreSQL 9.4 as a way to replace our then problematic usage of a third party NoSQL … Continue reading Celebrating Marten’s 10th Birthday! →

            In this post, we demonstrate how to implement real-time fraud prevention using GraphStorm v0.5&#39;s new capabilities for deploying graph neural network (GNN) models through Amazon SageMaker. We show how to transition from model training to production-ready inference endpoints with minimal operational overhead, enabling sub-second fraud detection on transaction graphs with billions of nodes and edges.

            TL;DR Over the past few years, AI has made remarkable progress, but it doesn’t always deliver what professional developers need. One key reason is that most models are trained on public datasets that don’t reflect the complex, real-world scenarios faced by professional developers every day. Without such real-world data, our AI tools will fall short. […]

            Our latest video generation model is more physically accurate, realistic, and controllable than prior systems. It also features synchronized dialogue and sound effects. Create with it in the new Sora app.

            Sora 2 is our new state of the art video and audio generation model. Building on the foundation of Sora, this new model introduces capabilities that have been difficult for prior video models to achieve– such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio, enhanced steerability, and an expanded stylistic range.

            Development teams are under growing pressure to secure their software supply chains. Teams need trusted images, streamlined deployments, and compliance-ready tooling from partners they can rely on long term. Our customers have made it clear that they’re not just looking for one-off vendors. They’re looking for true security partners across development and deployment. That’s why...

            Data API builder (DAB) provides REST and GraphQL endpoints over SQL Server, Azure Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Data Warehouse. REST endpoints support several HTTP headers that let you control how requests behave. These headers give you precision over updates, caching, and discovering new resources.

However, if you prefer using SSH for authentication (which is often more convenient with key-based auth), manually changing URLs can be tedious. Also, it can be even harder when dealing with submodules. Git&#39;s insteadOf configuration option provides an…

To be honest, besides documentation updates, the biggest work is just pushing more on the CritterWatch backend this week to see if that forces any breaking changes in the Wolverine internals.

            In this solution, we demonstrate how the user (a parent) can interact with a Strands or LangGraph agent in conversational style and get information about the immunization history and schedule of their child, inquire about the available slots, and book appointments. With some changes, AI agents can be made event-driven so that they can automatically send reminders, book appointments, and so on.

            The fundamental challenge with MCP-enabled attacks isn&#39;t technical sophistication. It&#39;s that hackers have figured out how to catfish your AI. These attacks work because they exploit the same trust relationships that make your development team actually functional. When your designers expect Figma files from agencies they&#39;ve worked with for years, when your DevOps folks trust...
