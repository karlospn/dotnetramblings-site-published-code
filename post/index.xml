            ZURU collaborated with AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and AWS Professional Services to implement a more accurate text-to-floor plan generator using generative AI. In this post, we show you why a solution using a large language model (LLM) was chosen. We explore how model selection, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be used to improve results.

            Non-conversational applications offer unique advantages such as higher latency tolerance, batch processing, and caching, but their autonomous nature requires stronger guardrails and exhaustive quality assurance compared to conversational applications, which benefit from real-time user feedback and supervision. This post examines four diverse Amazon.com examples of such generative AI applications.

            In this post, we give an overview of a well-established generative AI foundation, dive into its components, and present an end-to-end perspective. We look at different operating models and explore how such a foundation can operate within those boundaries. Lastly, we present a maturity model that helps enterprises assess their evolution path.

            OpenSearch offers a wide range of third-party machine learning (ML) connectors to support this augmentation. This post highlights two of these third-party ML connectors. The first connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Comprehend connector. In this post, we show you how to use this connector to invoke the LangDetect API to detect the languages of ingested documents. The second connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Bedrock connector to invoke the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2 model so that you can create embeddings from ingested documents and perform semantic search.

            In this post, we demonstrate an example of building an agentic RAG application using the LlamaIndex framework. LlamaIndex is a framework that connects FMs with external data sources. It helps ingest, structure, and retrieve information from databases, APIs, PDFs, and more, enabling the agent and RAG for AI applications. This application serves as a research tool, using the Mistral Large 2 FM on Amazon Bedrock generate responses for the agent flow.

            In this post, we show you how to implement and evaluate three powerful techniques for tailoring FMs to your business needs: RAG, fine-tuning, and a hybrid approach combining both methods. We provid ready-to-use code to help you experiment with these approaches and make informed decisions based on your specific use case and dataset.

            Rufus, an AI-powered shopping assistant, relies on many components to deliver its customer experience including a foundation LLM (for response generation) and a query planner (QP) model for query classification and retrieval enhancement. This post focuses on how the QP model used draft centric speculative decoding (SD)—also called parallel decoding—with AWS AI chips to meet the demands of Prime Day. By combining parallel decoding with AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, Rufus achieved two times faster response times, a 50% reduction in inference costs, and seamless scalability during peak traffic.

            Until now, Qodana linters have run exclusively in Docker containers. While this approach provided consistency and isolation, it also required significant effort for environment configuration, particularly for complex project setups or highly secured systems. Users have had to rely on the bootstrap mechanism to set up custom environments inside the Docker container, often duplicating the […]

            The quality of a project can be measured by having a look at how the code is written. SonarQube can help you by running static code analysis and letting you spot the pain points. Let’s learn how to install and run it locally with Docker.

            When debugging Java programs, developers are often under the impression that they’re interacting directly with the source code. This isn’t surprising – Java’s tooling does such an excellent job of hiding the complexity that it almost feels as if the source code exists at runtime. If you’re just starting with Java, you likely remember those […]

            The C# compiler is smart enough to understand some constructs and generates optimized code. However, C# gives you multiple ways to express the same intent. The compiler is not always smart enough to optimize every single ways. In this post, I will show you how to use pattern matching syntax to improve the performance of your code in some cases. Here&#39;s an example that checks if a version number is one of…

            This blog looks at implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications implemented using Blazor and ASP.NET Core. When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]
