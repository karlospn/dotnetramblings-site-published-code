            In this post, we present a new approach named multimodal RAG (mmRAG) to tackle those existing limitations in greater detail. The solution intends to address these limitations for practical generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistant use cases. Additionally, we examine potential solutions to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) with advanced LangChain capabilities, enabling them to generate more comprehensive, coherent, and accurate outputs while effectively handling multimodal data

            In this post, we explore a solution that addresses these challenges head-on using LoRA serving with Amazon SageMaker. By using the new performance optimizations of LoRA techniques in SageMaker large model inference (LMI) containers along with inference components, we demonstrate how organizations can efficiently manage and serve their growing portfolio of fine-tuned models, while optimizing costs and providing seamless performance for their customers. The latest SageMaker LMI container offers unmerged-LoRA inference, sped up with our LMI-Dist inference engine and OpenAI style chat schema.

            The article discusses the use of expression-bodied methods in .NET as an alternative to traditional methods for creating simple functions. It presents a comparison between the two methods in terms of syntax and performance. Despite the syntactical differences, benchmark results show that both methods demonstrate similar performance characteristics.

            The article discusses two methods for retrieving nullable values from reference types in C#, showcasing examples using the ternary conditional expression and the null coalesce approach. Benchmark results indicate that the null coalesce approach demonstrates 1.12 times higher efficiency in performance compared to the ternary conditional expression.

            The author shares their journey from Visual Basic 2 in 1992 to the latest tools like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (VS Code). They emphasize the evolution of Microsoft&#39;s IDEs for software, web, and database development. They advocate for a hybrid approach of using IDEs for efficiency and familiarizing with CLI commands for flexibility.

            While Generative AI can create highly realistic content, including text, images, and videos, it can also generate outputs that appear plausible but are verifiably incorrect. Incorporating human judgment is crucial, especially in complex and high-risk decision-making scenarios. This involves building a human-in-the-loop process where humans play an active role in decision making alongside the AI system. In this blog post, you will learn about prompt chaining, how to break a complex task into multiple tasks to use prompt chaining with an LLM in a specific order, and how to involve a human to review the response generated by the LLM.
