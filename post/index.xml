            A customer was writing a Win32 program and was looking for something like a combo box, in that it gave the user a choice among various fixed options, but sometimes the program would come up with a new option that wasn&#39;t on the list, and it would want to show that as the selection. On the other hand, the customer didn&#39;t want to give the user

            A year ago, I wrote a blog post about solving Advent of Code puzzles using Rust as the implementation language. I believe it’s still relevant if you plan to use Rust this year. In one section, I advised limiting the use of AI and demonstrated how to disable the relevant functionality in RustRover, either partially […]

            Do you know who managed to cut costs by a staggering 90% by abandoning microservices for a monolith in May 2023? Not a cash-strapped startup or an indie project—Amazon itself, for its Prime Video service. The same AWS that earns billions every year by selling microservices infrastructure admitted that, sometimes, a good old monolith wins. ...

So they had a great idea: Their program already had a message-only window, so they figured, &amp;quot;Hey, I already have this garbage window I can use as the owner of s

Everything should just seamlessly work… but it doesn’t. Why? Because names don’t match. Storage accounts are globally unique. Key Vault names are different across regions.

            In this post, we explore how Myriad Genetics partnered with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to transform their healthcare document processing pipeline using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova foundation models, achieving 98% classification accuracy while reducing costs by 77% and processing time by 80%. We detail the technical implementation using AWS&#39;s open-source GenAI Intelligent Document Processing Accelerator, the optimization strategies for document classification and key information extraction, and the measurable business impact on Myriad&#39;s prior authorization workflows.

            In this post, CBRE and AWS demonstrate how they transformed property management by building a unified search and digital assistant using Amazon Bedrock, enabling professionals to access millions of documents and multiple databases through natural language queries. The solution combines Amazon Nova Pro for SQL generation and Claude Haiku for document interactions, achieving a 67% reduction in processing time while maintaining enterprise-grade security across more than eight million documents.

            In this post, we introduce Managed Tiered KV Cache and Intelligent Routing for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, new capabilities that can reduce time to first token by up to 40% and lower compute costs by up to 25% for long context prompts and multi-turn conversations. These features automatically manage distributed KV caching infrastructure and intelligent request routing, making it easier to deploy production-scale LLM inference workloads with enterprise-grade performance while significantly reducing operational overhead.

            In this post, we focus on one portion of the REM™ system: the automatic identification of changes to the road structure which we will refer to as Change Detection. We will share our journey of architecting and deploying a solution for Change Detection, the core of which is a deep learning model called CDNet. We will share real-life decisions and tradeoffs when building and deploying a high-scale, highly parallelized algorithmic pipeline based on a Deep Learning (DL) model, with an emphasis on efficiency and throughput.

            In this post, we explore three essential strategies for successfully integrating AI into your organization: addressing organizational debt before it compounds, embracing distributed decision-making through the &amp;quot;octopus organization&amp;quot; model, and redefining management roles to align with AI-powered workflows. Organizations must invest in both technology and workforce preparation, focusing on streamlining processes, empowering teams with autonomous decision-making within defined parameters, and evolving each management layer from traditional oversight to mentorship, quality assurance, and strategic vision-setting.

            Introduction Web applications use counter operations to deliver interactive user experiences. Whether tracking social media engagement metrics or managing e-commerce inventory levels, these operations must be both reliable and scalable. This post walks you through two architectural patterns that deliver predictable performance. To illustrate these patterns, let us consider a social media application post-liking feature. […]

            Spring’s AOT engine has been around since the Spring Native days, but Spring Data never really benefited from it – until now. Repository infrastructure is one of the most dynamic parts of the framework, and for years it relied heavily on proxies, reflection, and queries generated at runtime. That flexibility has a price: it slows […]

            We&#39;re introducing bidirectional streaming for Amazon SageMaker AI Inference, which transforms inference from a transactional exchange into a continuous conversation. This post shows you how to build and deploy a container with bidirectional streaming capability to a SageMaker AI endpoint. We also demonstrate how you can bring your own container or use our partner Deepgram&#39;s pre-built models and containers on SageMaker AI to enable bi-directional streaming feature for real-time inference.

            In this post, we explore the complete development lifecycle of physical AI—from data collection and model training to edge deployment—and examine how these intelligent systems learn to understand, reason, and interact with the physical world through continuous feedback loops. We illustrate this workflow through Diligent Robotics&#39; Moxi, a mobile manipulation robot that has completed over 1.2 million deliveries in hospitals, saving nearly 600,000 hours for clinical staff while transforming healthcare logistics and returning valuable time to patient care.

            In this post, we explore how Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, enabling you to partition powerful GPUs into multiple isolated instances for running concurrent workloads like inference, research, and interactive development. By maximizing GPU utilization and reducing wasted resources, MIG helps organizations optimize costs while maintaining performance isolation and predictable quality of service across diverse machine learning tasks.

            A customer reported that their program encountered rendering problems when they created elements that were a half billion pixels tall, and they wondered why this was happening. A half billion pixels is an awful lot of pixels. At 96 pixels per inch, that gives you an element whose height is over 82 miles (132 km). There is no monitor

            Naming resources in Azure shouldn’t feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. Yet, without a solid standard, names can quickly become inconsistent, confusing, and downright chaotic. The result? A messy Azure environment that’s hard to search, manage, and govern. This guide will show you exactly how to establish and enforce Azure naming conventions using the open source Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform module — […] The article How To Automate Azure Naming Conventions with the Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform Module was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we introduce the Multi-Provider Generative AI Gateway reference architecture, which provides guidance for deploying LiteLLM into an AWS environment to streamline the management and governance of production generative AI workloads across multiple model providers. This centralized gateway solution addresses common enterprise challenges including provider fragmentation, decentralized governance, operational complexity, and cost management by offering a unified interface that supports Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and external providers while maintaining comprehensive security, monitoring, and control capabilities.

By combining Foursquare Spatial H3 Hub&#39;s analysis-ready geospatial data with reasoning models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can build agents that enable nontechnical domain experts to perform sophisticated spatial analysis through natural language queries—without requiring geographic information system (GIS) expertise or custom data engineering pipelines.
