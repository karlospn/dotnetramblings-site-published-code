            This post focuses on doing RAG on heterogeneous data formats. We first introduce routers, and how they can help managing diverse data sources. We then give tips on how to handle tabular data and will conclude with multimodal RAG, focusing specifically on solutions that handle both text and image data.

            The Cohere Embed multimodal embeddings model is now generally available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. This model is the newest Cohere Embed 3 model, which is now multimodal and capable of generating embeddings from both text and images, enabling enterprises to unlock real value from their vast amounts of data that exist in image form. In this post, we discuss the benefits and capabilities of this new model with some examples.

            In this post, we discuss how GoDaddy’s Care &amp;amp; Services team, in close collaboration with the AWS GenAI Labs team, built Lighthouse—a generative AI solution powered by Amazon Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case.

            In this post, we showcase how to fine-tune a text and vision model, such as Meta Llama 3.2, to better perform at visual question answering tasks. The Meta Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct models demonstrated impressive performance on the challenging DocVQA benchmark for visual question answering. By using the power of Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, we demonstrate the process of adapting these generative AI models to excel at understanding and responding to natural language questions about images.

            Cloud costs can significantly impact your business operations. Gaining real-time visibility into infrastructure expenses, usage patterns, and cost drivers is essential. To allocate costs to cloud resources, a tagging strategy is essential. This post outlines steps you can take to implement a comprehensive tagging governance strategy across accounts, using AWS tools and services that provide visibility and control. By setting up automated policy enforcement and checks, you can achieve cost optimization across your machine learning (ML) environment.

            We recently announced the general availability of cross-account sharing of Amazon SageMaker Model Registry using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM), making it easier to securely share and discover machine learning (ML) models across your AWS accounts. In this post, we will show you how to use this new cross-account model sharing feature to build your own centralized model governance capability, which is often needed for centralized model approval, deployment, auditing, and monitoring workflows.

In this post, we discuss a new feature that supports the integration of model cards with the model registry. We discuss the solution architecture and best practices for managing model cards with a registered model version, and walk through how to set up, operationalize, and govern your models using the integration in the model registry.

            In this blog post, we demonstrate prompt engineering techniques to generate accurate and relevant analysis of tabular data using industry-specific language. This is done by providing large language models (LLMs) in-context sample data with features and labels in the prompt. The results are similar to fine-tuning LLMs without the complexities of fine-tuning models.

            On CI, some projects use the msbuild diagnostic verbosity to get more information about the build. This is useful to troubleshoot build issues. However, this verbosity level has some drawbacks. In this post, I describe how to use the binary log feature of MSBuild to get the same information in a more efficient way. Diagnostic verbosity vs binary log The msbuild diagnostic verbosity is the most verbose…

            Ever made a change to your Blazor app’s CSS only to find, when you publish your app, it seems to be stuck using the old styles? Modern browsers love to cache static assets like stylesheets. It speeds up performance and saves re-fetching the same thing multiple times from the server. The problem comes when you make changes to the stylesheet and push out a new version. Unless you change the filename of the stylesheet, the browser sees that your site is requesting a file it’s already cached and diligently serves the contents from the cache.
