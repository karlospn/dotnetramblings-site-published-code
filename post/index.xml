            When working with LLMs, an extremely valuable use case is generating structured data as the output response of the AI prompt. Whether you’re building an app, prototyping a data pipeline, or performing data extraction or transformation, receiving structured outputs like JSON saves time and makes downstream processing seamless. But there’s a challenge: these models are […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid JSON Data was originally published on Build5Nines.

            JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a popular data storage and transmitting format. Whether you are a front-end or back-end developer, you must be familiar with it. As a.NET developer, you don&#39;t need an introduction to this text-based data format. The two most prominent libraries are Newtonsoft.Json

            Prompt caching, now generally available on Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, along with Nova Micro, Nova Lite, and Nova Pro models, lowers response latency by up to 85% and reduces costs up to 90% by caching frequently used prompts across multiple API calls. This post provides a detailed overview of the prompt caching feature on Amazon Bedrock and offers guidance on how to effectively use this feature to achieve improved latency and cost savings.

            AI is quickly becoming a core part of modern applications, but running large language models (LLMs) locally can still be a pain. Between picking the right model, navigating hardware quirks, and optimizing for performance, it’s easy to get stuck before you even start building. At the same time, more and more developers want the flexibility […]

            In this post, we introduce a state-of-the-art method to fine-tune LLMs by reinforcement learning, reviewed the pros and cons of RLHF vs. RLAIF vs. DPO, and saw how to scale LLM fine-tuning efforts with RLAIF. We also see how to implement an end-to-end RLAIF pipeline on SageMaker using the Hugging Face Transformer and TRL libraries, and using either off-the-shelf toxicity reward models to align responses during PPO or by directly prompting an LLM to generate quantitative reward feedback during PPO.

            In optimizing the Spargine project, I improved performance by avoiding constant arrays as method arguments. Instead, using static readonly fields reduced memory allocations significantly. This change enhanced execution speed, yielding a 1.34x performance gain. I recommend enabling CA1856 warnings in .editorconfig to maintain performance-focused coding practices.

            Inspecting wind turbines, power lines, 5G towers, and pipelines is a tough job. It’s often dangerous, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This post is the first in a three-part series exploring AI Workforce, the AWS AI-powered drone inspection system. In this post, we introduce the concept and key benefits. The second post dives into the AWS architecture that powers AI Workforce, and the third focuses on the drone setup and integration.

If you’re a MediatR user, Wolverine just does a helluva lot more and we have an existing guide for converting from MediatR to Wolverine. For MassTransit (or NServiceBus) users, Wolverine covers a lot of the same asynchronous messaging framework use cases, but does … Continue reading A Quick Note About JasperFx’s Plans for Marten &amp;amp; Wolverine →

            Managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform is as common as CI/CD pipelines and incident response playbooks. However, there are moments when you don’t want Terraform to touch everything. Maybe you need to quickly redeploy an Azure Function App, or perhaps a specific Storage Account needs an urgent configuration change without disturbing unrelated resources. The […] The article Applying Terraform Changes to Specific Resources using the -target Argument was originally published on Build5Nines.

This can be incredibly useful for logging, debugging, or tracing. The attributes CallerMemberName, CallerFilePath, and CallerLineNumber provide information such as the name of the calling method, the path to the source file […]

            This tutorial was brought to you by Rajkumar Venkatasamy, draft.dev. Microservice architecture has become a cornerstone for building scalable and maintainable applications. Microservices allow individual services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, resulting in faster delivery cycles and improved fault isolation. For example, an e-commerce platform can use independent services to handle product catalogs, […]

            In applications such as personalized recommendations and scientific research, accurately identifying the closest data points to a given query is crucial. Traditional methods like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search offer faster retrieval times by approximating results but may sacrifice accuracy, leading to potential errors in scenarios where precision is essential. This trade-off between speed and […]

            I&#39;m pleased to announce my latest Pluralsight course, Refactor and Optimize Code with GitHub Copilot, has just gone live. It will be part of a series of courses covering various aspects of using GitHub Copilot, and my course focuses specifically on using Copilot to refactor, modernize and optimize code. This is an important topic as many of us are spending a lot of time working on existing legacy codebases, and learning to use GenAI effectively with these projects is a great investment of your time.
