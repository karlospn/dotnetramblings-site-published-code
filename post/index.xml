            What is Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)? “Global Interpreter Lock” (or “GIL”) is a familiar term in the Python community. It is a well-known Python feature. But what exactly is a GIL? If you have experience with other programming languages (Rust, for example), you may already know what a mutex is. It’s an abbreviation for […]

            There’s nothing quite like the thrill of shipping an app and turning an idea into something real that people can use. This summer, you’ve got the perfect chance to capture that feeling at RevenueCat Shipaton 2025 — a two-month global hackathon focused on launching new mobile apps (August 1 to September 30).

            Docker recently completed an internal 24-hour hackathon that had a fairly simple goal: create an agent that helps you be more productive. As I thought about this topic, I recognized I didn&#39;t want to spend more time in a chat interface. Why can&#39;t I create a fully automated agent that doesn’t need a human to...

            In this post, we demonstrate how to create a powerful research assistant for drug discovery using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock. This AI assistant can search multiple scientific databases simultaneously using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), synthesize its findings, and generate comprehensive reports on drug targets, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic areas.

This feedback-driven approach has enabled us to create more effective prompts that adapt to various subsystems while maintaining high performance across different use cases.

            This post explores how the AWS Serverless MCP server accelerates development throughout the serverless lifecycle, from making architectural decisions with tools like get_iac_guidance and get_lambda_guidance, to streamlining development with get_serverless_templates, sam_init, to deployment with SAM integration, webapp_deployment_help, and configure_domain. We show how this conversational AI approach transforms the entire process, from architecture design through operations, dramatically accelerating AWS serverless projects while adhering to architectural principles.

            In Microsoft .NET, managing files and directories can lead to errors. The Spargine library, featuring the DriveHelper class, simplifies this task with methods to retrieve drive information and manage drives. Additional utility types, like DirectoryHelper and FileProcessor, enhance file and path management, improving efficiency and reliability in .NET applications.

            EF 10 introduces named query filters, allowing multiple filters on a single entity and letting you selectively disable specific filters without turning off all query filters. This article explains how the feature works, shows practical examples for combining soft deletion and multi-tenancy, highlights best practices like using constants for filter names, and explores where such fine-grained control is particularly useful.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent eDiscovery solution using Amazon Bedrock Agents for real-time document analysis. We show how to deploy specialized agents for document classification, contract analysis, email review, and legal document processing, all working together through a multi-agent architecture. We walk through the implementation details, deployment steps, and best practices to create an extensible foundation that organizations can adapt to their specific eDiscovery requirements.

Our team has expanded its functionality by integrating it with the Amazon Bedrock API to enable using Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet on Amazon as judge. In this post, we use both MT-Bench and Arena-Hard to benchmark Amazon Nova models by comparing them to other leading LLMs available through Amazon Bedrock.

            As large language models (LLMs) evolve from static text generators to dynamic agents capable of executing actions, there&#39;s a growing need for a standardized way to let them interact with external tooling securely. That’s where Model Context Protocol (MCP) steps in, a protocol designed to turn your existing APIs into AI-accessible tools. My name is...

            At the AWS Summit in New York City, we introduced a comprehensive suite of model customization capabilities for Amazon Nova foundation models. Available as ready-to-use recipes on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can use them to adapt Nova Micro, Nova Lite, and Nova Pro across the model training lifecycle, including pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and alignment. In this post, we present a streamlined approach to customize Nova Micro in SageMaker training jobs.

            In this post, we introduce a solution that uses OpenSearch Service as a vector data store in multi-tenant RAG, achieving data isolation and routing using JWT and FGAC. This solution uses a combination of JWT and FGAC to implement strict tenant data access isolation and routing, necessitating the use of OpenSearch Service.

            In 2024, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched the Generative AI Accelerator Challenge (GENIAC)—a Japanese national program to boost generative AI by providing companies with funding, mentorship, and massive compute resources for foundation model (FM) development. AWS was selected as the cloud provider for GENIAC’s second cycle (cycle 2). It provided infrastructure and technical guidance for 12 participating organizations.
