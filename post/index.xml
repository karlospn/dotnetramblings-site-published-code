            Did you know? The [InternalsVisibleTo] attribute in .NET is a powerful feature that allows an assembly to expose its internal members (normally only accessible within the same assembly) to another specified assembly. This is typically used in scenarios like unit testing or multi-assembly projects where tight integration between assemblies is needed. Welcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! […]

      <title>Microsoft .NET Code Analysis: Creating Empty Arrays</title>

            Arrays are a key collection type in .NET. There are three methods to create empty arrays: new string[0], Array.Empty(), and the concise [] expression. Benchmark tests show the [] expression is the fastest and most memory-efficient option. For improved performance, developers should adopt this method in their codebases.

            DRY Principle is seemingly advocated for or against. In reality, it’s not good or bad so as long as you understand why you’re applying it and for what purpose. Misunderstanding DRY is why your system can turn into a hard to change rats nest.

            In this post, we explore a generative AI solution leveraging Amazon Bedrock to streamline the WAFR process. We demonstrate how to harness the power of LLMs to build an intelligent, scalable system that analyzes architecture documents and generates insightful recommendations based on AWS Well-Architected best practices. This solution automates portions of the WAFR report creation, helping solutions architects improve the efficiency and thoroughness of architectural assessments while supporting their decision-making process.

            Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases has a metadata filtering capability that allows you to refine search results based on specific attributes of the documents, improving retrieval accuracy and the relevance of responses. These metadata filters can be used in combination with the typical semantic (or hybrid) similarity search. In this post, we discuss using metadata filters with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

            In this two-part series, we discuss how you can reduce the DeepSeek model customization complexity by using the pre-built fine-tuning workflows (also called “recipes”) for both DeepSeek-R1 model and its distilled variations, released as part of Amazon SageMaker HyperPod recipes. In this first post, we will build a solution architecture for fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and demonstrate the approach by providing a step-by-step example on customizing the DeepSeek-R1 Distill Qwen 7b model using recipes, achieving an average of 25% on all the Rouge scores, with a maximum of 49% on Rouge 2 score with both SageMaker HyperPod and SageMaker training jobs.

            This guide demonstrates how to deploy an open source foundation model from Hugging Face on Amazon EC2 instances across three locations: a commercial AWS Region and two AWS Local Zones. Through comparative benchmarking tests, we illustrate how deploying foundation models in Local Zones closer to end users can significantly reduce latency—a critical factor for real-time applications such as conversational AI assistants.

            In this blog, we’re exploring the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern—a powerful method for smoothing out workload spikes Why Choose Queue-Based Load Leveling? In today’s fast-paced software environment, dynamic workloads are common. The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern decouples the production and consumption of tasks by introducing a queue between them. This allows producers and consumers to work independently, […]

            This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to security risks but […]

            As a network engineer, administrator, or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) you probably have run across CIDR notation for defining IPv4 address spaces for both networks and subnets. CIDR notation is used a lot in the IT infrastructure configuration world. The following is a description of what CIDR notation is, in case you’re not that familiar, […] The article IP Subnet Calculator and Reference (Cloud, Azure, Private, IPv4 CIDR, and more) was originally published on Build5Nines.

            This article highlights the importance of custom comparers in .NET for enhancing application performance when sorting and ordering collections. It discusses the flexibility and control that custom comparers offer over default comparers and provides examples of creating them. Benchmarks also illustrate the performance benefits, while cautioning that custom comparers may introduce overhead in certain scenarios.

The previous post was left open-ended—with one last Championship Final left, it was too early to share all my secrets. Now that AWS re:Invent is over, it’s time to share my strategy, how I prepared, and how it went in the end.

            At ByteDance, we collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deploy multimodal large language models (LLMs) for video understanding using AWS Inferentia2 across multiple AWS Regions around the world. By using sophisticated ML algorithms, the platform efficiently scans billions of videos each day. In this post, we discuss the use of multimodal LLMs for video understanding, the solution architecture, and techniques for performance optimization.

            XML has been replaced by JSON as the primary serialization format. Using the JsonSerializer in .NET offers performance advantages, particularly when caching JsonSerializerOptions. This method enhances speed (1.34x faster) and reduces memory usage. Additionally, adhering to best practices avoids CA1869 rule violations. Consider optimizing your serialization approach for better performance.
