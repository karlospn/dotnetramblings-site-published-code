            In this post, we show how you can automate language localization through translating documents using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution combines Amazon Bedrock and AWS Serverless technologies, a suite of fully managed event-driven services for running code, managing data, and integrating applications—all without managing servers.

            Something that’s often overused, misunderstood, or just incorrectly applied in software development: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). DTOs are a common pattern, but like many things in software, they tend to get used in places where they don’t actually solve the problem at hand. So, what are DTOs really for? When should you use them? And… Read More »DTOs &amp;amp; Mapping : The Good, The Bad, And The Excessive The post DTOs &amp;amp; Mapping : The Good, The Bad, And The Excessive appeared first on CodeOpinion.

That’s right, the full-featured DataGrip database toolset isn’t just a separate product or an additional paid plugin anymore; it’s bundled into WebStorm. Even if you’re comfortable with other IDEs and their database extensions, you might find […]

            “Write less, do more.” That motto wasn’t just a clever tagline—it was a revolution. Before modern JavaScript frameworks became the norm, jQuery quietly changed everything. In the web development landscape now dominated by React, Angular, and Vue, it might be easy to forget a time when making a button click actually do something required verbose, […] The article Software Innovation: jQuery – The Tiny Library that Transformed the Web was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we highlight the advanced data augmentation techniques and performance improvements in Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation with Meta&#39;s Llama model family. This technique transfers knowledge from larger, more capable foundation models (FMs) that act as teachers to smaller, more efficient models (students), creating specialized models that excel at specific tasks.

            In this post, we present an LLM migration paradigm and architecture, including a continuous process of model evaluation, prompt generation using Amazon Bedrock, and data-aware optimization. The solution evaluates the model performance before migration and iteratively optimizes the Amazon Nova model prompts using user-provided dataset and objective metrics.

            In this post, we demonstrate model customization (fine-tuning) for tool use with Amazon Nova. We first introduce a tool usage use case, and gave details about the dataset. We walk through the details of Amazon Nova specific data formatting and showed how to do tool calling through the Converse and Invoke APIs in Amazon Bedrock. After getting the baseline results from Amazon Nova models, we explain in detail the fine-tuning process, hosting fine-tuned models with provisioned throughput, and using the fine-tuned Amazon Nova models for inference.

            In this post, we introduced the Open Source Bedrock Agent Evaluation framework, a Langfuse-integrated solution that streamlines the agent development process. We demonstrated how this evaluation framework can be integrated with pharmaceutical research agents. We used it to evaluate agent performance against biomarker questions and sent traces to Langfuse to view evaluation metrics across question types.

            When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), generating structured outputs like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is invaluable for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and integration with spreadsheet applications. However, since LLMs are primarily optimized for natural language generation, crafting prompts that yield valid CSV-formatted data requires careful engineering. This article provides strategies and examples to […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid CSV Data was originally published on Build5Nines.
