Recently, we’ve introduced resource leak analysis in GoLand […]

            In this post, we show how to build chat agents in Amazon Quick Suite. We walk through a three-layer framework—identity, instructions, and knowledge—that transforms Quick Suite chat agents into intelligent enterprise AI assistants. In our example, we demonstrate how our chat agent guides feature discovery, use enterprise data to inform recommendations, and tailors solutions based on potential to impact and your team’s adoption readiness.

            AgentCore Gateway now supports API GatewayAs organizations explore the possibilities of agentic applications, they continue to navigate challenges of using enterprise data as context in invocation requests to large language models (LLMs) in a manner that is secure and aligned with enterprise policies. This post covers these new capabilities and shows how to implement them.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent insurance underwriting agent that addresses three critical challenges: unifying siloed data across CRM systems and databases, providing explainable and auditable AI decisions for regulatory compliance, and enabling automated fraud detection with consistent underwriting rules. The solution combines Amazon Nova 2 Lite for transparent risk assessment, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for managed MCP server infrastructure, and Amazon Quick Suite for natural language interactions—delivering a production-ready system that underwriters can deploy in under 30 minutes .

            TL;DR Fleet started as our attempt to explore a new generation of JetBrains IDEs, developed in parallel with those based on the IntelliJ Platform. Over time, we learned that having two general-purpose IDE families created confusion and diluted our focus. Rebuilding the full capabilities of IntelliJ-based IDEs inside Fleet did not create enough value, and […]

As teams grow and workloads expand into Kubernetes and integrate into cloud services, simplicity fades. Kubernetes has become the operating system of the cloud, but your clusters rarely live in...

If you build services on the Java virtual machine (JVM), you likely know that most microservices run on Kubernetes. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for running containerized microservices at scale. However, Kubernetes […]

      <title>Immutable Collection Add() Trap: Don’t Get Burned — Use a Builder Instead</title>

      <description>
        
          
            When using immutable collections in .NET, remember that the Add() method creates a new instance rather than mutating the original. Ignoring the return value leads to ineffective loops. Instead, use a builder for efficiency, as it offers faster performance and lower memory allocation while still ensuring immutability in the final result.

            Learn how to safely parallelize EF Core queries to improve performance by using IDbContextFactory to create isolated contexts, avoiding the thread-safety exceptions caused by sharing a single DbContext instance.

            When building AI applications, context is key. AI models have a knowledge cutoff and do not have access to your personal or company data by default. To generate high-quality answers, AI apps need two things: Access to high-quality data The ability to surface the right information at the right time

            A straight look at what’s behind the keys We’ve all tried unlearning a keyboard shortcut - it feels like forgetting how to breathe. Muscle memory doesn’t mess around. We wrestle with this every time someone suggest a “quick” shortcut change. It’s not just editing a keybinding but navigating a history that makes Visual Stu

            A customer wanted to accept a directory entered by the user and verify that the user has permission to create files in that folder. The directory itself might not even be on a local hard drive; it could be a DVD or a remote network volume. They tried calling Get­File­Attributes, but all they were told was that it was a direct

            Trust is the most important consideration when you connect AI assistants to real tools. While MCP containerization provides strong isolation and limits the blast radius of malfunctioning or compromised servers, we’re continuously strengthening trust and security across the Docker MCP solutions to further reduce exposure to malicious code. As the MCP ecosystem scales from hundreds...

            OpenAI researchers are testing “confessions,” a method that trains models to admit when they make mistakes or act undesirably, helping improve AI honesty, transparency, and trust in model outputs.
