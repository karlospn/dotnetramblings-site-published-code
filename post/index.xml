            I had earlier said that “full” support for .NET Aspire would be a key part of the Wolverine 3.0 plans. After kicking the tires more on .NET Aspire and seeing where user priorities and our own road map is, I’m going to back off that statement quite a bit. Here’s what’s definitely in and actually … Continue reading Update on Wolverine 3.0 and Aspire →

This is a tale that starts with HashiCorp first developing Terraform, the popular open source, multi-cloud, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, and then eventually close sourcing it. As a result, the community forked the most recent open source Terraform version and spun it off into OpenTofu.

These patterns are often used interchangeably, and while they are very similar, there are some key differences that we will highlight. First, let’s talk about the two architectures.

            With last month’s blog, I started a series of posts that highlight the key factors that are driving customers to choose Amazon Bedrock. I explored how Bedrock enables customers to build a secure, compliant foundation for generative AI applications. Now I’d like to turn to a slightly more technical, but equally important differentiator for Bedrock—the multiple techniques that you can use to customize models and meet your specific business needs.

            The Timing Capture file format is a Sqlite database. Queries written in standard SQL syntax can be used to extract data from Timing Capture files to perform a variety of analysis tasks without requiring the PIX user interface. PIX on Windows includes a Sqlite extension that simplifies the queries for common tasks such as determining the duration and execution times for a PIX event,

            Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art approach to building question answering systems that combines the strengths of retrieval and foundation models (FMs). RAG models first retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of text and then use a FM to synthesize an answer based on the retrieved information. An end-to-end RAG solution involves several […]
