            The mission of Rich Data Co (RDC) is to broaden access to sustainable credit globally. Its software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution empowers leading banks and lenders with deep customer insights and AI-driven decision-making capabilities. In this post, we discuss how RDC uses generative AI on Amazon Bedrock to build these assistants and accelerate its overall mission of democratizing access to sustainable credit.

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can deploy an LLM such as DeepSeek-R1—or another FM of your choice—from popular model hubs like SageMaker JumpStart or Hugging Face Hub to SageMaker AI for real-time inference. We explore inference frameworks like Hugging Face TGI which helps streamline deployment while integrating built-in performance optimizations to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Additionally, we showcase how the SageMaker developer-friendly Python SDK simplifies endpoint orchestration, allowing seamless experimentation and scaling of LLM-powered applications.

            When using Entity Framework Core, I prefer to view the generated schema as SQL. This allows me to easily validate what EF is doing behind the scenes and ensures that no attributes are missed, such as accidentally using nvarchar(max). My main objectives are: Be notified when the schema changes Review the new schema while editing it and during code reviews The solution I use is use is to have a test that…

            In this article, we’ll introduce hybrid caching in .NET, a new cache type that bridges the existing cache mechanisms in .NET: distributed cache and memory cache. We’ll start by briefly explaining a cache and how existing caches in .NET work. After that, we’ll explore hybrid caching and show how it can be used and configured […] The post Hybrid Caching in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

            The .NET ecosystem has gradually fused CQRS and MediatR together, creating a reflexive assumption that they&#39;re inseparable, but this mental shortcut has led teams down a path of unnecessary complexity. This article dispels common misconceptions by explaining how CQRS and MediatR are distinct tools solving different problems, and demonstrates how to implement CQRS effectively with or without MediatR.

            This post provides detailed steps for setting up the key components of a multi-account ML platform. This includes configuring the ML Shared Services Account, which manages the central templates, model registry, and deployment pipelines; sharing the ML Admin and SageMaker Projects Portfolios from the central Service Catalog; and setting up the individual ML Development Accounts where data scientists can build and train models.

            Starter kits are complete, deployable solutions that address common, repeatable business problems. They deploy the services that make up a solution according to best practices, helping you optimize costs and become familiar with these kinds of architectural patterns without a large investment in training. In this post, we showcase a starter kit for Amazon Q Business. If you have a repository of documents that you need to turn into a knowledge base quickly, or simply want to test out the capabilities of Amazon Q Business without a large investment of time at the console, then this solution is for you.

            As technology continues to evolve, newer models are emerging, offering higher quality, increased flexibility, and faster image generation capabilities. One such groundbreaking model is Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), released by StabilityAI, advancing the text-to-image generative AI technology to unprecedented heights. In this post, we demonstrate how to efficiently fine-tune the SDXL model using SageMaker Studio. We show how to then prepare the fine-tuned model to run on AWS Inferentia2 powered Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances, unlocking superior price performance for your inference workloads.

            Azure Blob Storage is designed as a flat storage system without a traditional hierarchical structure. However, by incorporating forward slashes (/) in blob names, you can simulate a directory-like organization, creating virtual directories within your containers. This approach enhances data organization and accessibility, especially when dealing with large datasets. Conclusion Azure Blob Storage, while inherently […] The article Organizing Azure Blob Storage with Virtual Directories in C# was originally published on Build5Nines.

            This post was brought to you by Matt Keib, draft.dev. Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a security testing method designed to identify vulnerabilities in applications while running. Unlike static testing methods, which analyze code at rest, DAST interacts with live applications and mimics real-world attacks to uncover security flaws. This makes DAST particularly effective […]
