            I see the same two issues come up over and over with event sourcing — they cause a lot of pain and they shouldn’t have to. Most of the pain stems from bad modeling, specifically because of CRUD-Sourcing. In this post I want to show why long event streams usually mean you’re modeling the wrong… Read More »CRUD-Sourcing is why Your Event Streams Are Bloated The post CRUD-Sourcing is why Your Event Streams Are Bloated appeared first on CodeOpinion.

            AI agents are evolving beyond basic single-task helpers into more powerful systems that can plan, critique, and collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems. Deep Agents—a recently introduced framework built on LangGraph—bring these capabilities to life, enabling multi-agent workflows that mirror real-world team dynamics. The challenge, however, is not just building such agents but […]

            We’re excited to announce Trusted Publishing on nuget.org — a simpler, safer way to publish NuGet packages from GitHub Actions. Rather than relying on long‑lived API keys, your workflow can use a short‑lived GitHub OIDC token to request a temporary, single‑use NuGet API key. These keys expire quickly (≈ 1 hour), eliminating long‑

            ObservableList enhances the typical List by integrating event notifications for dynamic collection changes, making it ideal for MVVM applications in WPF, MAUI, and Xamarin. It supports multiple constructors, provides essential methods for collection management, and raises relevant events to keep UI synchronized, ensuring responsive and maintainable applications.

Empowering Junior Developers on Reviews If you have juniors on your team, you may have run into this:
Pull requests piling up Reviews slowing down ... and everyone quietly frustrated
Is it just because your code is too complex? Maybe not. Should we point the finger at the junior developers and blame them?

Unlike REST APIs that require multiple endpoints and round trips to gather related data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint. This enables clients to fetch exactly what they need in one request, improving […]

            We’re targeting October 1st for the release of Wolverine 5.0. At this point, I think I’d like to say that we’re not going to be adding any new features to Wolverine 4.* except for JasperFx Software client needs. And also, not that I have any pride about this, I don’t think we’re going to address … Continue reading Update on Wolverine 5 and CritterWatch →

            cagent is a new open-source project from Docker that makes it simple to build, run, and share AI agents, without writing a single line of code. Instead of writing code and wrangling Python versions and dependencies when creating AI agents, you define your agent&#39;s behavior, tools, and persona in a single YAML file, making it...

In April 2025, Docker introduced the first Beta release of Docker Model Runner, making it easy to manage, run, and distribute local AI models (specifically LLMs). Though only a short time has passed since then, the product has evolved rapidly, with continuous...
