            In C#, classes historically define types like in any other Object-Oriented Language. Classes define models, encapsulate data and behavior, and organize code. A new block organizer came into play with the launch of C# 9—Record. This article will explore C# records with practical code examples. I will also dive

            On CI, some projects use the msbuild diagnostic verbosity to get more information about the build. This is useful to troubleshoot build issues. However, this verbosity level has some drawbacks. In this post, I describe how to use the binary log feature of MSBuild to get the same information in a more efficient way. Diagnostic verbosity vs binary log The msbuild diagnostic verbosity is the most verbose…

            Ever made a change to your Blazor app’s CSS only to find, when you publish your app, it seems to be stuck using the old styles? Modern browsers love to cache static assets like stylesheets. It speeds up performance and saves re-fetching the same thing multiple times from the server. The problem comes when you make changes to the stylesheet and push out a new version. Unless you change the filename of the stylesheet, the browser sees that your site is requesting a file it’s already cached and diligently serves the contents from the cache.

            The post introduces a series called &amp;quot;dotNetDave&#39;s Faster or Not!&amp;quot; which aims to explore performance claims in .NET. It discusses method return patterns, comparing early returns and single-exit methods. Despite minor performance differences favoring early returns, the author advocates for their use due to improved readability and reduced complexity in coding.
