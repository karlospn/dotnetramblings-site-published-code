            In this post, we explore how organizations can cost-effectively customize and adapt FMs using AWS managed services such as Amazon SageMaker training jobs and Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. We discuss how these powerful tools enable organizations to optimize compute resources and reduce the complexity of model training and fine-tuning. We explore how you can make an informed decision about which Amazon SageMaker service is most applicable to your business needs and requirements.
