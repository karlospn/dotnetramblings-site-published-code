            In this post, we explore the Five V&#39;s Framework—a field-tested methodology that has helped 65% of AWS Generative AI Innovation Center customer projects successfully transition from concept to production, with some launching in just 45 days. The framework provides a structured approach through Value, Visualize, Validate, Verify, and Venture phases, shifting focus from &amp;quot;What can AI do?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;What do we need AI to do?&amp;quot; while ensuring solutions deliver measurable business outcomes and sustainable operational excellence.

Even if you got a new computer, you could install that same software on the new one. Only “serious” software packages had strict licensing restrictions. These days, most of our tools live in the cloud, guarded...

            In this post, we explore an innovative approach that converts natural language to Gremlin queries using Amazon Bedrock models such as Amazon Nova Pro, helping business analysts and data scientists access graph databases without requiring deep technical expertise. The methodology involves three key steps: extracting graph knowledge, structuring the graph similar to text-to-SQL processing, and generating executable Gremlin queries through an iterative refinement process that achieved 74.17% overall accuracy in testing.

            In this post, we explore how companies can systematically incorporate responsible AI practices into their generative AI project prioritization methodology to better evaluate business value against costs while addressing novel risks like hallucination and regulatory compliance. The post demonstrates through a practical example how conducting upfront responsible AI risk assessments can significantly change project rankings by revealing substantial mitigation work that affects overall project complexity and timeline.

            When the engineering team at Syncfusion set out to build BoldSign, a modern e-signature platform, they knew speed and stability would be critical. Supporting 40,000+ organizations across industries like finance, legal, and IT, BoldSign had to offer fast, secure document signing at scale without slowing down its own development cycles in the process. But as adoption grew, so […]

            One of the design principles of the Windows Runtime is that if an object has multiple writable properties, then you can set them in any order and the effect will be the same. For example, consider an object with three properties: Minimum, Maximum, and Value. Suppose the rule is that you must, a

            In this post, we explore how product teams can leverage Amazon Bedrock and AWS services to transform their creative workflows through generative AI, enabling rapid content iteration across multiple formats while maintaining brand consistency and compliance. The solution demonstrates how teams can deploy a scalable generative AI application that accelerates everything from product descriptions and marketing copy to visual concepts and video content, significantly reducing time to market while enhancing creative quality.

            In this post, we explore advanced cost monitoring strategies for Amazon Bedrock deployments, introducing granular custom tagging approaches for precise cost allocation and comprehensive reporting mechanisms that build upon the proactive cost management foundation established in Part 1. The solution demonstrates how to implement invocation-level tagging, application inference profiles, and integration with AWS Cost Explorer to create a complete 360-degree view of generative AI usage and expenses.

            In this post, we introduce a comprehensive solution for proactively managing Amazon Bedrock inference costs through a cost sentry mechanism designed to establish and enforce token usage limits, providing organizations with a robust framework for controlling generative AI expenses. The solution uses serverless workflows and native Amazon Bedrock integration to deliver a predictable, cost-effective approach that aligns with organizational financial constraints while preventing runaway costs through leading indicators and real-time budget enforcement.

            In this post, we demonstrate how Amazon Nova Premier with Amazon Bedrock can systematically migrate legacy C code to modern Java/Spring applications using an intelligent agentic workflow that breaks down complex conversions into specialized agent roles. The solution reduces migration time and costs while improving code quality through automated validation, security assessment, and iterative refinement processes that handle even large codebases exceeding token limitations.
