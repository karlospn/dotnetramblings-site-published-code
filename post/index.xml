            Signing commits in Git is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of your commits. This ensures that the commits are indeed made by you and have not been tampered with. On Windows, it&#39;s easy to set up SSH-Agent for easy signature. Here&#39;s how you can do it. First, you need to install SSH on Windows. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator and run the following command to install the OpenSSH…

            If you&#39;re like me, 2024 was the year in which using LLM for code generation went from a curiosity that I occasionally tried out when all other avenues failed, to something that has become an essential part of day-to-day development work. Availability and pricing When the year began the availability of these tools was mostly limited to paying customers, but with the majority of LLMs now offering completely free tiers that are perfectly capable of generating code, and now tools like GitHub Copilot (also now offering a free tier) that integrate directly with your IDE, it seems inevitable that in 2025 it will become an integral part of the way most developers write code.

            When tasked with modernizing a 40-year-old manufacturing system written in APL, I faced both technical complexity and organizational challenges that shaped my understanding of successful software development. This article shares key lessons learned during a four-year journey of rewriting critical legacy code while keeping a $10M business running smoothly.

            A customer asked if there was a helper function in the system that accepted two strings and reported whether the GUIDs they represent are equal. This is a tricky question, because you first have to decide what “represent” means. There are many ways of representing a GUID as a string. It could be just 32 […]

            Microsoft has announced the retirement of the azureedge.net domain by January 15, 2025, driven by Edgio’s (formerly Limelight Networks) business closure. This domain underpins Azure CDN services, .NET installations, and content delivery for various Azure and Microsoft services. The shift requires developers and DevOps teams to update configurations, pipelines, and deployment practices to ensure continuity. […] The article Retirement of AzureEdge.net DNS: Edg.io Business Closure and What You Need to Know was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this blog post, we showcase how you can perform efficient supervised fine tuning for a Meta Llama 3 model using PEFT on AWS Trainium with SageMaker HyperPod. We use HuggingFace’s Optimum-Neuron software development kit (SDK) to apply LoRA to fine-tuning jobs, and use SageMaker HyperPod as the primary compute cluster to perform distributed training on Trainium. Using LoRA supervised fine-tuning for Meta Llama 3 models, you can further reduce your cost to fine tune models by up to 50% and reduce the training time by 70%.
