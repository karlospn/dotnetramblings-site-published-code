            This post walks you through the end-to-end process of deploying a single custom model on SageMaker using NASA’s Prithvi model. The Prithvi model is a first-of-its-kind temporal Vision transformer pre-trained by the IBM and NASA team on contiguous US Harmonised Landsat Sentinel 2 (HLS) data. It can be finetuned for image segmentation using the mmsegmentation library for use cases like burn scars detection, flood mapping, and multi-temporal crop classification.

            The article analyzes performance issues in .NET code using SortedDictionary. It recommends using Dictionary for single sorting needs and compares various sorting techniques. Benchmark results reveal that sorting keys separately and iterating is fastest, while SortedDictionary excels with foreach loops. Careful choice of dictionary type affects performance and memory allocation.

            Whether during application startup, multi-step workflows, or monitoring an application’s overall health, verifying database connectivity is essential for smooth operation and graceful handling of potential failures. It improves reliability and the overall user experience. In modern containerized environments, often managed by orchestrators like Kubernetes (K8S), it’s equally important for services to report their health status.

            Today, we’re excited to announce multi-turn conversation with an agent node (preview), a powerful new capability in Flows. This new capability enhances the agent node functionality, enabling dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue in a flow execution.

            Whether during application startup, multi-step workflows, or monitoring an application’s overall health, verifying database connectivity is essential for smooth operation and graceful handling of potential failures. It improves reliability and the overall user experience. In modern containerized environments, often managed by orchestrators like Kubernetes (K8S), it’s equally important for services to report their health status. […] The post Testing Database Connectivity with EF Core appeared first on Code Maze.
