            This post shows how to implement an application which requires a user to authenticate using passkeys. The identity provider returns three claims to prove the authentication level (loa), the identity level, (loi) and the amr claim showing the used authentication method. Code: https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/swiyu-passkeys-idp-loi-loa Blogs in this series: The amr claim and the loa claim returns […]

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings addresses the challenges of crossmodal search through a practical ecommerce use case. We examine the technical limitations of traditional approaches and demonstrate how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings enables retrieval across text, images, and other modalities. You learn how to implement a crossmodal search system by generating embeddings, handling queries, and measuring performance. We provide working code examples and share how to add these capabilities to your applications.

            Per-aggregate ordering is what we really want. But queues with competing consumers make it surprisingly easy to break. This article shows how the “fix” naturally evolves into a saga.

            Quantized models can be seamlessly deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI using a few lines of code. In this post, we explore why quantization matters—how it enables lower-cost inference, supports deployment on resource-constrained hardware, and reduces both the financial and environmental impact of modern LLMs, while preserving most of their original performance. We also take a deep dive into the principles behind PTQ and demonstrate how to quantize the model of your choice and deploy it on Amazon SageMaker.

We present experiments comparing multiple machine learning (ML) models and services, discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of each approach, and highlight how AWS services can be orchestrated to build robust, end-to-end solutions.

            By a devoted advocate for individual choice
Introduction: Fire Protection, Reimagined 🚒 In a nation that prizes personal responsibility, it’s time to ask whether a single, taxpayer-funded fire department model still serves us best. A market of competing fire protection providers would let every household choose the coverage, response times, and perks that match their unique risk profile and budget. What’s more, it would allow individuals and households to prioritize how they want to spend their money, rather than leaving it up to big government and its known inefficiencies.

      <title>EF Core Lazy Loading Performance Gotcha</title>

            I was recently using EF Core&#39;s ILazyLoader for lazy loading without proxies, and ran into a performance issue that took me by surprise. When you call DbSet.Add() to add an entity to the context, EF Core immediately injects the lazy loader into your entity even before you&#39;ve called SaveChangesAsync(). This means if you navigate to a lazy-loaded navigation property before persisting, EF Core will try to query the database for related entities that don&#39;t exist yet.
