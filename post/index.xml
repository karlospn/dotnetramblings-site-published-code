            This post describes the agentic AI assistant built by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and the GenAIIC to respond to citizens’ questions about government procedures. The solution consists of two primary components: an input guardrail system that helps prevent the system from responding to harmful user queries and a government procedures agent that retrieves relevant information and generates responses.

In ReSharper 2025.2, analysis runs in a separate 64-bit worker out of Visual Studio’s UI process. Previously, ReSharper shared Visual Studio’s UI process, so long analyses could stall the UI thread. Now, […]

            In the Previous blog, I discussed source generators. .NET has introduced an improved version of a source generator, called Incremental Source Generator. The new type generates code faster and reduces the code, improving readability. In this post, I will introduce the new type of source generator and compare it to

            In previous versions of the Semantic Kernel, the encoding of template arguments was performed automatically if the argument type was a string. The encoding was not applied for custom types, anonymous types, or collections. With the latest changes, we&#39;ve introduced stricter rules: if automatic encoding is enabled (the default be

            In previous versions of the Semantic Kernel Python, the default fallback authentication mechanism for Azure services like AzureChatCompletion was DefaultAzureCredential from the Azure Identity library. This provided a convenient way to authenticate without explicitly passing credentials, especially during development.

            This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev. Developing and releasing iOS applications involves navigating a complex web of code signing, provisioning profiles, multiple iOS versions, and stringent App Store guidelines/requirements. Without an automated continuous integration, continuous delivery and/or deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, these challenges can lead to slower release cycles, increased errors, and […]

            The tracking pointer designs we&#39;ve been using so far have had O(n) complexity on move, where n is the number of outstanding tracking pointers. But we can reduce this to O(1) by the classic technique of introducing another level of indirection. What we can do is give every trackable object
