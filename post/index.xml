            Switching from BitConverter.ToString() to Convert.ToHexString() in .NET can significantly enhance performance and reduce memory usage for byte-to-hex conversions. This optimized method is faster and uses less memory, addressing best practices and CA1872 rule violations. For optimal results, consider updating your .editorConfig and exploring additional resources.

            In this post, we explain how F1 and AWS have developed a root cause analysis (RCA) assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock to reduce manual intervention and accelerate the resolution of recurrent operational issues during races from weeks to minutes. The RCA assistant enables the F1 team to spend more time on innovation and improving its services, ultimately delivering an exceptional experience for fans and partners. The successful collaboration between F1 and AWS showcases the transformative potential of generative AI in empowering teams to accomplish more in less time.

            Cloud development environments (CDEs) have become a game-changer for development teams, and for good reason. They simplify workflows, reduce project setup time, and eliminate configuration headaches. While most discussions about CDEs focus exclusively on software developers, in reality, the benefits of CDEs extend far beyond coders. They can boost productivity for every team member involved […]

Our latest Python Developer Survey Results confirm that these three frameworks remain developers’ top choices for backend web development with Python. All three frameworks are open-source and compatible with the latest versions of Python. But how do you determine […]

However, using and maintaining these classes can sometimes be tedious for the developers and the application’s memory. You might need to define separate classes or

            Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid growth of semantic search applications. Semantic search understands both user intent and content context, rather than just matching keywords. LLMs enhance this capability through their advanced language processing abilities. These AI models can process multiple content formats, including text, images, audio, and video. The users receive […]

            To better protect themselves, many cyclists are starting to ride with cameras mounted to the front or back of their bicycle. In this blog post, I will demonstrate a machine learning solution that cyclists can use to better identify close calls. The architecture of the solution uses Amazon Rekognition to detect vehicles in recorded bike ride videos. It then analyzes the video to determine if any vehicles are passing too close to the cyclist, within the 3-foot safe distance required by law.

            Database migrations are critical to modern application development and deployment, enabling teams to evolve their database schema alongside their application code. However, as systems grow in complexity and scale, managing migrations becomes increasingly challenging. At scale, a simple schema update can impact several microservices, terabytes of data, and global user traffic. It requires careful planning, […]

            In this article, we are going to learn about integrating Keycloak authentication in a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) frontend and a .NET Web API backend. With this setup, we will enable secure user authentication across both applications. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication, authorization, and user management out of the […] The post Keycloak Authentication With ASP.NET Core Web API and Blazor WebAssembly appeared first on Code Maze.

            While offset pagination is widely used, cursor-based pagination offers significant performance advantages - my tests show a 17x speedup when paginating through a million-record dataset in PostgreSQL. Let&#39;s take a deep dive into cursor pagination, compare it with offset pagination, and examine the SQL execution plans.

            本文翻译自 Máňa, Natalia 和 Anton 创作的 .NET 9 Networking Improvements 秉承我们的传统，我们很高兴与您分享这篇博客文章，以介绍新的 .NET 版本中网络领域相关的最新动态和最有趣的变化。今年，我们带来了 HTTP 领域的改变、新的 HttpClientFactory API、.NET Framework 兼容性优化等更多内容。 HTTP 在接下来的部分中，我们将介绍 HTTP 领域最具影响力的变化。其中包括连接池的性能优化、对多个HTTP/3连接的支持、Windows代理的自动更新，以及重要的社区贡献。 连接池 在此版本中，我们对HTTP连接池进行了两项显著的性能优化。 我们增加了对多个HTTP/3连接的可选支持。根据RFC 9114标准文档，由于连接可以多路复用并行请求，因此不鼓励使用多个HTTP/3连接到对等端。然而，在某些场景下，例如服务器到服务器的通信，即使请求多路复用，单一连接也可能成为瓶颈。我们在 HTTP/2 中看到了这样的限制（dotnet/runtime#35088），它同样具有在单一连接上多路复用的概念。出于同样的原因（dotnet/runtime#51775），我们决定为HTTP/3实现多连接支持（dotnet/runtime#101535）。 该实现本身尽可能贴近 HTTP/2 多连接机制的行为。当前，它的策略是优先填充已有连接，直到达到对端允许的请求上限后，才会创建新的连接。不过，需要注意的是，这是一个具体的实现细节，该行为在未来可能会有所变化。 结果是，我们的基准测试显示每秒请求数（RPS）有显著提升，以下是10,000个并行请求的对比结果： 客户端 单 HTTP/3 连接 多 HTTP/3 连接 最大CPU使用率(%) 35 92 最大核心使用率(%) 971 2572 最大工作集(MB) 3810 6491 最大私有内存(MB) 4415 7228 处理器数量 28 28 […]

            In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Bedrock to generate synthetic training data to fine-tune an LLM. Additionally, we provide concrete evaluation results that showcase the power of synthetic data in fine-tuning when data is scarce.

            Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used.

            In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing.

Instead, it explicitly ensures that the object remains referenced at a specific point in the code after it’s last used. It’s particularly useful when dealing with […]
