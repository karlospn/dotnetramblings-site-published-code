            For platform engineers, securely managing sensitive information across dev and test environments is a critical responsibility. Each workflow, from provisioning virtual machines to deploying artifacts and automating environment setup, often involves handling credentials, SSH keys, and API tokens.

            Developer experience is not only about nice editors and fast build times. It is about reducing friction so developers can focus on solving problems rather than fighting with tools. Among the most effective developer experience tools available today is static code analysis. By examining code without running it, static analysis surfaces potential issues early and […]

            In this post, we take an animated short film, Picchu, produced by FuzzyPixel from Amazon Web Services (AWS), prepare training data by extracting key character frames, and fine-tune a character-consistent model for the main character Mayu and her mother, so we can quickly generate storyboard concepts for new sequels like the following images.

            The art of storyboarding stands as the cornerstone of modern content creation, weaving its essential role through filmmaking, animation, advertising, and UX design. Though traditionally, creators have relied on hand-drawn sequential illustrations to map their narratives, today’s AI foundation models (FMs) are transforming this landscape. FMs like Amazon Nova Canvas and Amazon Nova Reel offer […]

            Running large AI models in the cloud gives access to immense capabilities, but it doesn’t come for free. The bigger the models, the bigger the bills, and with them, the risk of unexpected costs. Local models flip the equation. They safeguard privacy and keep costs predictable, but their smaller size often limits what you can...

            Many developers have run into subtle issues with annotations when working with Kotlin and frameworks like Spring or JPA-based persistence frameworks. For instance, an annotation applied to a constructor parameter might not always end up in the property or backing field where the framework expects it. This often means annotations don’t land where they’re needed. […]

            MCP is not an API. Tools are not agents. MCP is more than tools. Here’s what this means in practice. Most developers misread the Model Context Protocol because they map it onto familiar API mental models. That mistake breaks agent designs, observability, and the “last mile” where non-deterministic reasoning must meet deterministic execution. This piece...

            In this post, we demonstrate how to use the new Amazon SageMaker HyperPod CLI and SDK to streamline the process of training and deploying large AI models through practical examples of distributed training using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) and model deployment for inference. The tools provide simplified workflows through straightforward commands for common tasks, while offering flexible development options through the SDK for more complex requirements, along with comprehensive observability features and production-ready deployment capabilities.

            In this post, we explore how natural language database analytics can revolutionize the way organizations interact with their structured data through the power of large language model (LLM) agents. Natural language interfaces to databases have long been a goal in data management. Agents enhance database analytics by breaking down complex queries into explicit, verifiable reasoning steps and enabling self-correction through validation loops that can catch errors, analyze failures, and refine queries until they accurately match user intent and schema requirements.

            In this blog post, we demonstrate an end-to-end approach for building and evaluating a KIE solution using Amazon Nova models available through Amazon Bedrock. This end-to-end approach encompasses three critical phases: data readiness (understanding and preparing your documents), solution development (implementing extraction logic with appropriate models), and performance measurement (evaluating accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness). We illustrate this comprehensive approach using the FATURA dataset—a collection of diverse invoice documents that serves as a representative proxy for real-world enterprise data.
