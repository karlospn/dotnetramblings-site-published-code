            Looking at my contribution graph now, I can see the whole journey mapped out in squares of green. The startup dreams. The pivot to teaching. The thousands of commits that represent years of building, learning, and growing. Every cluster tells a story. What will your graph look like a year from now?

      <title>How can you swap two adjacent blocks of memory using only forward iterators?</title>

            Last time, we noted that the std::rotate function requires only forward iterators. The algorithm we explored last time involved a clever sequence of reversals, but reversals require bidirectional iterators (one to iterator forward from the beginning and another to iterate backward from the end).

            Suppose you have a large block of memory, and you want to swap two blocks that reside inside that large block. For concreteness, say you have a block of memory of the form A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, E1, and you want to swap the B&#39;s and D&#39;s, producing A1, A2, D1, D2, D3, C1, C2, B1, B2, E1.

            Visual Studio 2026 has regressed by removing or disabling key code-quality features, making development more difficult. The Analyze tool suffers from inconsistencies and lack of reliability, while various testing functionalities are also flawed. AI tools like Copilot cannot replace essential code-quality features. Greater MVP involvement and thoughtful updates are needed to enhance the IDE.

Pluralsight Part of the reason for me not having as much time for blogging is that I created three new Pluralsight courses this year, bringing my total to 29. First up was a course about refactoring and optimizing code with GitHub Copilot.

            If you&#39;re using self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, you might have noticed they can be surprisingly CPU-intensive, even when idle. A closer look reveals that a single runner can peg a CPU core at 100% utilization. This isn&#39;t a bug in your workflow; it&#39;s a deliberate design choice in the runner&#39;s sleep mechanism. The problem: Busy-waiting Instead of using standard, efficient sleep functions provided by the…

            This excerpt discusses enhancing Microsoft .NET application performance by minimizing network calls. The author emphasizes client-side caching with Spargine’s InMemoryCache, which drastically improves responsiveness and scalability for costly operations like reflection. While significant speed gains are noted, developers are advised to benchmark changes, as caching may not always be beneficial.
