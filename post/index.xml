            IntelliJ IDEA has great support for debugging Java and Kotlin applications. But if you are building Spring Boot applications, you may want to access Spring components along with their metadata. That’s where the Spring Debugger plugin comes in. It makes life easier by letting you explore and use the entire Spring ApplicationContext right from your […]

            Starting from the 2025.3 release, DataGrip and other JetBrains IDEs with database support will stop using the term query console. From now on, we’ll use query file – because consoles were essentially files all along, and it’s time the UI reflected that. We’ve made the workflow simpler, more discoverable, and more consistent.

            In this post, we explore how the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and Quora collaborated to build a unified wrapper API framework that dramatically accelerates the deployment of Amazon Bedrock FMs on Quora’s Poe system. We detail the technical architecture that bridges Poe’s event-driven ServerSentEvents protocol with Amazon Bedrock REST-based APIs, demonstrate how a template-based configuration system reduced deployment time from days to 15 minutes, and share implementation patterns for protocol translation, error handling, and multi-modal capabilities.

            We hear you. And you’re right – the new quotas are a reduction from what you experienced. When we launched, we had little usage data for agentic experiences and no top‑up feature existed, so we set quotas much higher than the real cost of AI usage (tokens from providers) as a temporary measure. That felt […]

            Async operations are an integral part of any application. In C#, mostly asynchronous methods return Task or Task, but there&#39;s also the odd case of async void. We know void is for synchronous operations, so why does C# even allow async void? I will dissect

            Developers are increasingly relying on AI agents to both build new software as well as extend capabilities of existing projects that they support. One challenge with AI-based systems, however, is that to produce the right output you need to first establish really good context. If you don&#39;t decide what you&#39;re building and why you&#39;re bu

Nobody knows, because nobody&#39;s tracking it properly. But here&#39;s what I do know after years of watching teams build AI systems: the study masks a much more important problem. Teams...

            This addendum to the GPT-5 system card shares a new model: GPT-5-Codex, a version of GPT-5 further optimized for agentic coding in Codex. GPT-5-Codex adjusts its thinking effort more dynamically based on task complexity, responding quickly to simple conversational queries or small tasks, while independently working for longer on more complex tasks.

            DistinctConcurrentBag in Spargine is a thread-safe, unordered collection that ensures uniqueness of elements, preventing duplicates. It offers methods for adding, removing, checking, and enumerating items, making it ideal for concurrent programming in .NET. For blocking behavior with uniqueness, DistinctBlockingCollection is recommended.

            In this post, we explore how log probabilities work with imported models in Amazon Bedrock. You will learn what log probabilities are, how to enable them in your API calls, and how to interpret the returned data. We also highlight practical applications—from detecting potential hallucinations to optimizing RAG systems and evaluating fine-tuned models—that demonstrate how these insights can improve your AI applications, helping you build more trustworthy solutions with your custom models.

            GitHub releases are fantastic for distributing your open-source projects, as they let you turn any code revision into ready-to-go assets with a detailed version history. What makes them particularly popular, though, is that they give users a proper Download button (because not everyone dreams of compiling source code). In TeamCity, the traditional approach for publishing […]

            In real-world video and image analysis, businesses often face the challenge of detecting objects that weren’t part of a model’s original training set. This becomes especially difficult in dynamic environments where new, unknown, or user-defined objects frequently appear. In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Data Automation uses OSOD to enhance video understanding.

            We are excited to announce the availability of the Technology Innovation Institute (TII)’s Falcon-H1 models on Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. With this launch, developers and data scientists can now use six instruction-tuned Falcon-H1 models (0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-Deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B) on AWS, and have access to a comprehensive suite of hybrid architecture models that combine traditional attention mechanisms with State Space Models (SSMs) to deliver exceptional performance with unprecedented efficiency.

            This post explores how Oldcastle partnered with AWS to transform their document processing workflow using Amazon Bedrock with Amazon Textract. We discuss how Oldcastle overcame the limitations of their previous OCR solution to automate the processing of hundreds of thousands of POD documents each month, dramatically improving accuracy while reducing manual effort.
