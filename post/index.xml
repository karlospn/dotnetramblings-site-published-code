            Organizations often face challenges when implementing single-shot fine-tuning approaches for their generative AI models. The single-shot fine-tuning method involves selecting training data, configuring hyperparameters, and hoping the results meet expectations without the ability to make incremental adjustments. Single-shot fine-tuning frequently leads to suboptimal results and requires starting the entire process from scratch when improvements are […]

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory transforms raw conversational data into persistent, actionable knowledge through sophisticated extraction, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms that mirror human cognitive processes. The system tackles the complex challenge of building AI agents that don&#39;t just store conversations but extract meaningful insights, merge related information across time, and maintain coherent memory stores that enable truly context-aware interactions.

            When managing reference counts, there is an asymmetry between incrementing and decrementing: Incrementing the reference count can use relaxed semantics, but decrementing requires release semantics (and destroying requires acquire semantics). The asymmetry may strike you as odd, but maybe it shouldn&#39;t. After all, it&#39;s not surprising

Developers are realizing they need a system of agents: different types of agents working together to accomplish more complex tasks. For example, a researcher to find information, a writer to summarize,...

            In the world of .NET, memory management is an important aspect of any application. Fortunately, you don&#39;t have to shoulder this immense task yourself. .NET handles it with the superpower of the Garbage Collector (GC). A GC is an engine that keeps your app fast, responsive, and resource-efficient.
