            In the world of .NET, memory management is an important aspect of any application. Fortunately, you don&#39;t have to shoulder this immense task yourself. .NET handles it with the superpower of the Garbage Collector (GC). A GC is an engine that keeps your app fast, responsive, and resource-efficient.

            Development and testing of AWS integrated applications incur AWS costs and need reliable internet connectivity. LocalStack helps reduce AWS costs by running emulated AWS services locally, while also eliminating connectivity issues. In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to reduce AWS costs for a sample .NET application in Development and Test cycles by setting […]

            In this post, we introduce Amazon Nova customization for text content moderation through Amazon SageMaker AI, enabling organizations to fine-tune models for their specific moderation needs. The evaluation across three benchmarks shows that customized Nova models achieve an average improvement of 7.3% in F1 scores compared to the baseline Nova Lite, with individual improvements ranging from 4.2% to 9.2% across different content moderation tasks.

Years of data—listen counts, retention rates, performance metrics—all sitting there, waiting to tell a story. But I&#39;m not in the mood to spend days building dashboards and wrangling data.

This time, we’re narrowing the focus. Instead of asking a model to be good at everything, we can specialize it:...
