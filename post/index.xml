            Microsoft has announced the retirement of the azureedge.net domain by January 15, 2025, driven by Edgio‚Äôs (formerly Limelight Networks) business closure. This domain underpins Azure CDN services, .NET installations, and content delivery for various Azure and Microsoft services. The shift requires developers and DevOps teams to update configurations, pipelines, and deployment practices to ensure continuity. [‚Ä¶] The article Retirement of AzureEdge.net DNS: Edg.io Business Closure and What You Need to Know was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this blog post, we showcase how you can perform efficient supervised fine tuning for a Meta Llama 3 model using PEFT on AWS Trainium with SageMaker HyperPod. We use HuggingFace‚Äôs Optimum-Neuron software development kit (SDK) to apply LoRA to fine-tuning jobs, and use SageMaker HyperPod as the primary compute cluster to perform distributed training on Trainium. Using LoRA supervised fine-tuning for Meta Llama 3 models, you can further reduce your cost to fine tune models by up to 50% and reduce the training time by 70%.

LLMs like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o and Google‚Äôs Gemini Pro have dominated headlines for their massive scale and capabilities. However, Microsoft is redefining this narrative with Phi-4, a 14-billion parameter small language model (SLM) that delivers exceptional performance, rivaling models many times its size.

            When building voice-enabled chatbots with Amazon Lex, one of the biggest challenges is accurately capturing user speech input for slot values. Transcription confidence scores can help ensure reliable slot filling. This blog post outlines strategies like progressive confirmation, adaptive re-prompting, and branching logic to create more robust slot filling experiences.

            Lettria, an AWS Partner, demonstrated that integrating graph-based structures into RAG workflows improves answer precision by up to 35% compared to vector-only retrieval methods. In this post, we explore why GraphRAG is more comprehensive and explainable than vector RAG alone, and how you can use this approach using AWS services and Lettria.

            Ten years ago I wrote an article entitled Five Audio Processing Tasks that are a Lot Harder than you Think. It was borne out of my frustration that many users of my NAudio library had unrealistic expectations about what was achievable. But things have moved on a lot in a decade, and in particular the recent stunning advances in AI and machine learning have essentially solved many of these problems, and unlocked new possibilities I couldn&#39;t have imagined when I wrote that original post.

            This post provides step-by-step instructions for creating a collaborative multi-agent framework with reasoning capabilities to decouple business applications from FMs. It demonstrates how to combine Amazon Bedrock Agents with open source multi-agent frameworks, enabling collaborations and reasoning among agents to dynamically execute various tasks. The exercise will guide you through the process of building a reasoning orchestration system using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Agents, and FMs. We also explore the integration of Amazon Bedrock Agents with open source orchestration frameworks LangGraph and CrewAI for dispatching and reasoning.
