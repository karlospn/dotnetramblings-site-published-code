What defines resiliency &amp;amp; reliability isn’t the absence of failure, but how systems anticipate, isolate, and recover from them. Here is a

            What’s Double Dispatch? Well, before we get to what it is, there is a common belief in domain-driven design that you want to keep your domain pure, meaning no dependencies, no services, no distractions. I get it because you do not want that core logic coupled to infrastructure concerns like database calls. You want it… Read More »Double Dispatch in DDD The post Double Dispatch in DDD appeared first on CodeOpinion.

            Windows Control Flow Guard (CFG) is a defense in depth feature which validates indirect call targets. The idea is that each module that is enabled for CFG provides a bitmap that describes which addresses in the module are intended to be targets of indirect calls. When CFG is enabled in a process, indirect function calls are checked against

            gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b are two open-weight reasoning models post-trained from the gpt-oss models and trained to reason from a provided policy in order to label content under that policy. In this report, we describe gpt-oss-safeguard’s capabilities and provide our baseline safety evaluations on the gpt-oss-safeguard models, using the underlying gpt-oss models as a baseline. For more information about the development and architecture of the underlying gpt-oss models, see the original gpt-oss model model card⁠.

            In this post, we explore how to deploy NVIDIA&#39;s Parakeet ASR model on Amazon SageMaker AI using asynchronous inference endpoints to create a scalable, cost-effective pipeline for processing large volumes of audio data. The solution combines state-of-the-art speech recognition capabilities with AWS managed services like Lambda, S3, and Bedrock to automatically transcribe audio files and generate intelligent summaries, enabling organizations to unlock valuable insights from customer calls, meeting recordings, and other audio content at scale .

            Defensive programming emphasizes anticipating potential failures in code, treating every line as a possible error point. Developers should use structured exception handling, provide meaningful error messages, and maintain system integrity. Tools like Spargine facilitate effective defensive programming by simplifying error handling and promoting resilience in applications by addressing unexpected scenarios.

            Discover how a simple interview question about report generation reveals the difference between optimizing code and designing scalable systems, and why the best solution isn&#39;t making it faster, but making it asynchronous.

            I’m Mike Coleman, a staff solutions architect at Docker. In this role, I spend a lot of time talking to enterprise customers about AI adoption. One thing I hear over and over again is that these companies want to ensure appropriate guardrails are in place when it comes to deploying AI tooling. For instance, many...

            In this post, we explore the critical design considerations for building responsible AI systems in healthcare and life sciences, focusing on establishing governance mechanisms, transparency artifacts, and security measures that ensure safe and effective generative AI applications. The discussion covers essential policies for mitigating risks like confabulation and bias while promoting trust, accountability, and patient safety throughout the AI development lifecycle.

            In this post, we explore the Five V&#39;s Framework—a field-tested methodology that has helped 65% of AWS Generative AI Innovation Center customer projects successfully transition from concept to production, with some launching in just 45 days. The framework provides a structured approach through Value, Visualize, Validate, Verify, and Venture phases, shifting focus from &amp;quot;What can AI do?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;What do we need AI to do?&amp;quot; while ensuring solutions deliver measurable business outcomes and sustainable operational excellence.

            Remember when owning software meant you bought a CD, installed it, and it was yours until your computer died? Even if you got a new computer, you could install that same software on the new one. Only “serious” software packages had strict licensing restrictions. These days, most of our tools live in the cloud, guarded...
