            What’s the difference between HashiCorp’s Terraform and OpenTofu? This is a tale that starts with HashiCorp first developing Terraform, the popular open source, multi-cloud, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, and then eventually close sourcing it. As a result, the community forked the most recent open source Terraform version and spun it off into OpenTofu. Let’s […] The article Terraform vs OpenTofu: What’s the difference? was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this article, we are going to discuss the differences between onion architecture and clean architecture in .NET. These patterns are often used interchangeably, and while they are very similar, there are some key differences that we will highlight. First, let’s talk about the two architectures.

Onion architecture is a type […] The post What are the Differences Between Onion Architecture and Clean Architecture in .NET? appeared first on Code Maze.

            With last month’s blog, I started a series of posts that highlight the key factors that are driving customers to choose Amazon Bedrock. I explored how Bedrock enables customers to build a secure, compliant foundation for generative AI applications. Now I’d like to turn to a slightly more technical, but equally important differentiator for Bedrock—the multiple techniques that you can use to customize models and meet your specific business needs.
