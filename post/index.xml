            Did you know? In C#, you can use a feature called caller info attributes to obtain information about the caller of a method. This can be incredibly useful for logging, debugging, or tracing. The attributes CallerMemberName, CallerFilePath, and CallerLineNumber provide information such as the name of the calling method, the path to the source file […]

            The current cyber security climate demands that applications not only provide outstanding features but also prioritize the security of user data. Applications like Visual Studio rely on token-based authentication to access resources on your behalf. While effective, token-based authentication can be susceptible to attacks if not properly protected. Today, we are happy to announce that […]

            The application of code rules is often conveyed as unidirectional and one-size-fits-all. In other words, when we learn to develop, we tend to read that there is only one way to produce quality code, and only one way to implement rules or patterns.With this series of articles, we aim

            When developing web applications using ASP.NET Core, we frequently encounter scenarios where we need to manage collections of strings. These collections can originate from various sources, such as HTTP headers, query strings, form data, and configuration settings. Efficiently handling these collections is crucial for maintaining the performance and scalability of our web applications. That’s where […] The post StringValues in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

The Keycloak application is hosted in a docker container. The applications are run locally using .NET Aspire. This makes it really easy to develop using containers. Code: […]

            In this post, we explore a solution that uses the vector engine ChromaDB and Meta Llama 3, a publicly available foundation model hosted on SageMaker JumpStart, for a Text-to-SQL use case. We shared a brief history of Meta Llama 3, best practices for prompt engineering with Meta Llama 3 models, and an architecture pattern using few-shot prompting and RAG to extract the relevant schemas stored as vectors in ChromaDB.

            In this post, we provide insights and practical examples to help balance and optimize the prompt engineering workflow. We focus on advanced prompt techniques and best practices for the models provided in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API. With these prompting techniques, developers and researchers can harness the full capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, providing clear and concise communication while mitigating potential risks or undesirable outputs.

            本篇翻译于Jakub Jareš的Supercharge your testing experience with MSTest.Analyzers – .NET Blog (microsoft.com) MSTest 附带一组分析器，用于检查您的测试代码并指出常见的错误和陷阱。这些错误可能很微妙，并导致测试框架完全忽略您的测试。 我们从 3.2.0 版本就开始提供这些分析器了，但在最新的 3.5.1 版本中，我们添加了一些我们认为您不应错过的分析器。 遗漏的测试 一个常见问题是当您忘记在类上添加 [TestClass] 时。MSTest 将无法知道类中有测试，也不会运行它们： public class MyTests { [TestMethod] public async Task TestMethod1() { Assert.Fail(); } } 如果没有 MSTest.Analyzers，此代码在构建时不会出现警告或信息提示。运行测试时也不会出现测试失败的情况。由于类上没有 [TestClass] 属性，MSTest 会出于性能原因跳过整个类，并且您的测试将永远不会被找到。 但是使用分析器时您会在构建过程中收到一条信息提示： 我们建议将此信息提示升级为警告，甚至是构建错误。可以通过在 .editorconfig 文件中添加以下这行代码来实现 [*.cs] # MSTEST0030: Type containing &#39;[TestMethod]&#39; should be marked with &#39;[TestClass]&#39; dotnet_diagnostic.MSTEST0030.severity = warning 为什么默认情况下这不是警告？ 您可能会问为什么 MSTEST0030 默认是一条信息提示而不是默认的警告。原因是我们不能在 MSTest v3 中引入重大变更，而上述代码是一个常见的模式，用于从基类重用测试。 public class MyTestsBase { [TestMethod] public async Task CommonTestMethod() { } } [TestClass] public class MyTests : MyTestsBase { [TestMethod] public async Task TestMethod1() { Assert.

            The AWS DeepRacer League is the world’s first autonomous racing league, open to everyone and powered by machine learning (ML). AWS DeepRacer brings builders together from around the world, creating a community where you learn ML hands-on through friendly autonomous racing competitions. As we celebrate the achievements of over 560,000 participants from more than 150 countries who sharpened their skills through the AWS DeepRacer League over the last 6 years, we also prepare to close this chapter with a final season that serves as both a victory lap and a launching point for what’s next in the world of AWS DeepRacer.

            Feature Flags are just conditional statements but can be much more powerful. Use them so you can integrate features before they are ready to be used in production. But they have a lot more utility than just being simple toggles. Here are different ways of thinking and using feature flags.

            In this blog post, we will show you how to implement tenant isolation using Amazon Bedrock agents within a multi-tenant environment. We’ll demonstrate this using a sample multi-tenant e-commerce application that provides a service for various tenants to create online stores. This application will use Amazon Bedrock agents to develop an AI assistant or chatbot capable of providing tenant-specific information, such as return policies and user-specific information like order counts and status updates.

            In this post, we show you how to use Amazon Bedrock to automate email responses to customer queries. With our solution, you can identify the intent of customer emails and send an automated response if the intent matches your existing knowledge base or data sources. If the intent doesn’t have a match, the email goes to the support team for a manual response.

            Semantic Kernel allows prompts to be automatically converted to ChatHistory instances. Developers can create prompts which include tags and these will be parsed (using an XML parser) and converted into instances of ChatMessageContent. See mapping of prompt syntax to completion service model for more information.

We demonstrate how to set up authentication for the Web Crawler. The second data source is the official documentation for Amazon Q Business.
