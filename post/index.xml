            The market for pre-hardened container images is experiencing explosive growth as security-conscious organizations pursue the ultimate efficiency: instant security with minimal operational overhead. The value proposition is undeniably compelling‚Äîhardened images with minimal dependencies promise security &amp;quot;out of the box,&amp;quot; enabling teams to focus on building and shipping applications rather than constantly revisiting low-level configuration management....

            Slow APIs hurt users&#39; experience and the owners&#39; pocket. Users become disappointed, and the server costs more if APIs are not up to standard in large projects. I also faced a similar issue in my project. However, I cut down the performance overhead marginally. This article breaks down

            In this post, we explore how to enable and use trusted identity propagation in Amazon SageMaker Studio, which allows organizations to simplify access management by granting permissions to existing AWS IAM Identity Center identities. The solution demonstrates how to implement fine-grained access controls based on a physical user&#39;s identity, maintain detailed audit logs across supported AWS services, and support long-running user background sessions for training jobs.

            This post demonstrates how to use foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock, specifically Amazon Nova Pro, to achieve high-accuracy document field localization while dramatically simplifying implementation. We show how these models can precisely locate and interpret document fields with minimal frontend effort, reducing processing errors and manual intervention.

            We built an advanced RAG solution using Amazon Bedrock leveraging Infosys Topaz‚Ñ¢ AI capabilities, tailored for the oil and gas sector. This solution excels in handling multimodal data sources, seamlessly processing text, diagrams, and numerical data while maintaining context and relationships between different data elements. In this post, we provide insights on the solution and walk you through different approaches and architecture patterns explored, like different chunking, multi-vector retrieval, and hybrid search during the development.

The agent uses Amazon Nova, which offers an optimal balance of performance and cost compared to other commercial LLMs. By combining accurate but cost-efficient Amazon Nova models with LangGraph orchestration capabilities, we create a practical travel assistant that can handle complex planning tasks while keeping operational costs manageable for production deployments.

The solution uses NVIDIA NIMs for both LLM inference and text embedding services, with the NIM Operator handling their deployment and management. The architecture incorporates Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings for similarity search.

            In the blog post Scalable intelligent document processing using Amazon Bedrock, we demonstrated how to build a scalable IDP pipeline using Anthropic foundation models on Amazon Bedrock. Although that approach delivered robust performance, the introduction of Amazon Bedrock Data Automation brings a new level of efficiency and flexibility to IDP solutions. This post explores how Amazon Bedrock Data Automation enhances document processing capabilities and streamlines the automation journey.

            In this post, Amazon shares how they developed a multi-node inference solution for Rufus, their generative AI shopping assistant, using Amazon Trainium chips and vLLM to serve large language models at scale. The solution combines a leader/follower orchestration model, hybrid parallelism strategies, and a multi-node inference unit abstraction layer built on Amazon ECS to deploy models across multiple nodes while maintaining high performance and reliability.

            In this post, we explore Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory, a fully managed service that enables AI agents to maintain both immediate and long-term knowledge, transforming one-off conversations into continuous, evolving relationships between users and AI agents. The service eliminates complex memory infrastructure management while providing full control over what AI agents remember, offering powerful capabilities for maintaining both short-term working memory and long-term intelligent memory across sessions.

            In this post, we explore an innovative solution that uses Amazon Bedrock Agents, powered by Amazon Nova Lite, to create a conversational interface for Athena queries. We use AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) as an example, but this solution can be adapted for other databases you query using Athena. This approach democratizes data access while preserving the powerful analytical capabilities of Athena, so you can interact with your data using natural language.
