            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Claude are enabling enterprises like Cox Automotive and Druva to deploy production-ready agentic AI systems that deliver measurable business value, with results including up to 63% autonomous issue resolution and 58% faster response times. We examine the technical foundation combining Claude&#39;s frontier AI capabilities with AgentCore&#39;s enterprise-grade infrastructure that allows organizations to focus on agent logic rather than building complex operational systems from scratch.

            Many .NET projects use well-known GUIDs as identifiers for activities, interop scenarios, database keys, and other purposes. It&#39;s common to see code like new Guid(&amp;quot;01234567-8901-2345-6789-012345678901&amp;quot;) throughout applications. While this approach is readable and straightforward, it comes with a hidden performance cost that can impact application startup time. This is a micro-optimization that primarily…

            Developers spend much of their time editing, refactoring, and debugging rather than producing entirely new code. Code creation tends to involve non-sequential back-and-forth refinement rather than typing out a complete function in one uninterrupted sequence. You might sketch a part, adjust parameters, skip ahead, then revisit earlier sections to refine them. Diffusion models, and in […]

            This article emphasizes defensive programming by highlighting safe type compatibility checks in .NET. It advises using the &#39;is&#39; keyword to prevent InvalidCastException and warns against unnecessary type casts that clutter code and affect performance. The open-source project Spargine aids developers with tools for better validation and logging, promoting cleaner, more resilient applications.

            With .NET 10, Microsoft introduced file-based apps, which give you the ability to write C# code in a single .cs file and run it directly, without any project or solution files. This feature finally makes C# approachable for quick scripts and utilities

            Long build times are one of the top pain points for C++ projects. If you’ve ever waited too long for a C++ build to finish, you know how much it can slow down your productivity. In past years, we introduced C++ Build Insights to help you analyze traces and find bottlenecks. However, we know that

            The phrase “bad code” gets thrown around in reviews and online forums all the time. But what does it actually mean? It’s a good example of the vague terms that occasionally make the rounds in developer circles without much to qualify them. We’ve collected opinions on the subject, metrics, and code risks that you can […]

You&#39;ll learn how to deploy A2A servers on AgentCore Runtime, configure agent discovery and authentication, and build a real-world multi-agent system for incident response. We&#39;ll cover the complete A2A request lifecycle, from agent card discovery to task delegation, showing how standardized protocols eliminate the complexity of multi-agent coordination.

In this post, we dive into the benefits and unique capabilities of Embed 4 for enterprise search use cases. We’ll show you how to quickly get started using Embed 4 on Amazon Bedrock, taking advantage of integrations with Strands Agents, S3 Vectors, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build powerful agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

            The regulatory landscape for GxP compliance is evolving to address the unique characteristics of AI. Traditional Computer System Validation (CSV) approaches, often with uniform validation strategies, are being supplemented by Computer Software Assurance (CSA) frameworks that emphasize flexible risk-based validation methods tailored to each system&#39;s actual impact and complexity (FDA latest guidance). In this post, we cover a risk-based implementation, practical implementation considerations across different risk levels, the AWS shared responsibility model for compliance, and concrete examples of risk mitigation strategies.

            Whenever possible, Windows 95 made application compatibility tweaks through things like compatibility flags that alter the behavior of the system for any program the flag was applied to. Using compatibility flags allows the fix to be generalized: If one program has a problem, there&#39;s a good chance that another program will also have that sa

The Docker MCP Catalog now hosts hundreds of containerized local MCP servers, enabling developers to quickly experiment and prototype locally.

An agent is an LLM that calls your functions in a loop until it decides the task is complete. That shift […]

            In this post, we demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs provides a powerful and flexible approach to automate and significantly enhance document understanding capabilities. We also demonstrate that using focused fine-tuning allows smaller, multi-modal models to compete effectively with much larger counterparts (98% accuracy with Qwen2.5 VL 3B).
