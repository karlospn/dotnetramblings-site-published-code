            Modern IDEs are powerful tools with many useful features. When we talk about developer productivity, one thing that comes to mind is mastering the IDE – learning its features, like refactorings, navigation, or code generation, and remembering how to invoke them. However, discovering all the relevant features of your IDE, and knowing when and how […]

            Every developer recognises the trade-off. You can take the shortcut that delivers today but breaks tomorrow, or choose the slower approach that earns lasting confidence. This dilemma has become even more poignant with the widespread integration of AI agents into real workflows. Speed feels tempting, but speed without trust usually wastes more time than it […]

Both applications use Duende IdentityServer as the identity provider. The MCP server requires delegated DPoP access tokens.

            Parameter validation is crucial in programming, ensuring applications reject bad data before it causes issues. It safeguards data integrity, reduces bugs, and enhances developer satisfaction. The use of meaningful exceptions and tools like Spargine can standardize validation, while adopting strategies like nameof improves error messaging accuracy. Consistent validation fosters reliable APIs.

            If you’ve ever tried to track down a bug in concurrent programs, you know how chaotic and frustrating it can be: everything seems to work fine, then suddenly crashes, and you can’t quite pin down why – all while the bugs slip through. To bring order to this chaos, at JetBrains Research we built LitmusKt […]

            gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b are two open-weight reasoning models post-trained from the gpt-oss models and trained to reason from a provided policy in order to label content under that policy. In this report, we describe gpt-oss-safeguard’s capabilities and provide our baseline safety evaluations on the gpt-oss-safeguard models, using the underlying gpt-oss models as a baseline. For more information about the development and architecture of the underlying gpt-oss models, see the original gpt-oss model model card⁠.
