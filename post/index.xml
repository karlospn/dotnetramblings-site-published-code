            In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings addresses the challenges of crossmodal search through a practical ecommerce use case. We examine the technical limitations of traditional approaches and demonstrate how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings enables retrieval across text, images, and other modalities. You learn how to implement a crossmodal search system by generating embeddings, handling queries, and measuring performance. We provide working code examples and share how to add these capabilities to your applications.

            Per-aggregate ordering is what we really want. But queues with competing consumers make it surprisingly easy to break. This article shows how the “fix” naturally evolves into a saga.

            Quantized models can be seamlessly deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI using a few lines of code. In this post, we explore why quantization matters—how it enables lower-cost inference, supports deployment on resource-constrained hardware, and reduces both the financial and environmental impact of modern LLMs, while preserving most of their original performance. We also take a deep dive into the principles behind PTQ and demonstrate how to quantize the model of your choice and deploy it on Amazon SageMaker.

We present experiments comparing multiple machine learning (ML) models and services, discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of each approach, and highlight how AWS services can be orchestrated to build robust, end-to-end solutions.

            By a devoted advocate for individual choice
Introduction: Fire Protection, Reimagined 🚒 In a nation that prizes personal responsibility, it’s time to ask whether a single, taxpayer-funded fire department model still serves us best. A market of competing fire protection providers would let every household choose the coverage, response times, and perks that match their unique risk profile and budget. What’s more, it would allow individuals and households to prioritize how they want to spend their money, rather than leaving it up to big government and its known inefficiencies.

            This two-part series explores Flo Health&#39;s journey with generative AI for medical content verification. Part 1 examines our proof of concept (PoC), including the initial solution, capabilities, and early results. Part 2 covers focusing on scaling challenges and real-world implementation. Each article stands alone while collectively showing how AI transforms medical content management at scale.

            This post shows an automated PII detection and redaction solution using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails through a use case of processing text and image content in high volumes of incoming emails and attachments. The solution features a complete email processing workflow with a React-based user interface for authorized personnel to more securely manage and review redacted email communications and attachments. We walk through the step-by-step solution implementation procedures used to deploy this solution.

            Observe.ai developed the One Load Audit Framework (OLAF), which integrates with SageMaker to identify bottlenecks and performance issues in ML services, offering latency and throughput measurements under both static and dynamic data loads. In this blog post, you will learn how to use the OLAF utility to test and validate your SageMaker endpoint.

      <description>
        
          
            I was recently using EF Core&#39;s ILazyLoader for lazy loading without proxies, and ran into a performance issue that took me by surprise. When you call DbSet.Add() to add an entity to the context, EF Core immediately injects the lazy loader into your entity even before you&#39;ve called SaveChangesAsync(). This means if you navigate to a lazy-loaded navigation property before persisting, EF Core will try to query the database for related entities that don&#39;t exist yet.

            AI agents introduce a challenge that traditional software doesn’t have: non-determinism. The same prompt can produce different outputs across runs, making reliable testing difficult. Add API costs and latency to the mix, and developer productivity takes a hit. Session recording in cagent addresses this directly. Record an AI interaction once, replay it indefinitely—with identical results,...

            Software development context is the real bottleneck, not writing code. AI can generate code fast, but without context, boundaries, and language, you get coupling and brittle systems. YouTube Check out my YouTube channel, where I post all kinds of content on Software Architecture &amp;amp; Design, including this video showing everything in this post. With AI, I think… Read More »Context Is the Bottleneck in Software Development The post Context Is the Bottleneck in Software Development appeared first on CodeOpinion.

When authenticating using OpenID Connect and passkeys authentication, the OpenID Connect Extended Authentication Profile (EAP) ACR Values 1.0 specification should be used for the implementation. The amr claim should return the pop value. Blogs […]
