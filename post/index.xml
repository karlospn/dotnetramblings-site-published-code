            Amazon SageMaker Canvas offers no-code solutions that simplify data wrangling, making time series forecasting accessible to all users regardless of their technical background. In this post, we explore how SageMaker Canvas and SageMaker Data Wrangler provide no-code data preparation techniques that empower users of all backgrounds to prepare data and build time series forecasting models in a single interface with confidence.

            In this post, we demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds.

            A long time ago, I stood in a packed room at VS Live! and watched developers erupt in applause after a debugging demo shaved hours off a real-world problem. That was the moment I realized this wasn’t just a conference—it was a place where developers and toolmakers come together to push the craft forward. I’m excited to announce that I

This problem plagued C++ until C++11 added a special rule:¹ [temp.names] (4): When parsing a template-argument-list, the first non-nested &amp;gt; is taken as the ending delimiter rath

            Some applications are displaying sensitive information. With Recall, Windows can take a screenshot of your screen regularly and store sensitive information. You can exclude your application from this feature, and screen capture more generally, by using SetWindowDisplayAffinity and the WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE flag. This is a Windows API function that allows you to set the display affinity of a window, which…

            The EU AI Act establishes comprehensive regulations for AI development and deployment within the EU. AWS is committed to building trust in AI through various initiatives including being among the first signatories of the EU&#39;s AI Pact, providing AI Service Cards and guardrails, and offering educational resources while helping customers understand their responsibilities under the new regulatory framework.

            In this post, we discuss how SageMaker HyperPod and SageMaker Studio can improve and speed up the development experience of data scientists by using IDEs and tooling of SageMaker Studio and the scalability and resiliency of SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS. The solution simplifies the setup for the system administrator of the centralized system by using the governance and security capabilities offered by the AWS services.

            At Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering, we are big fans of integration tests. They are the best way to test that your system works as a whole, but sometimes, integration tests are overkill or too complex to set up that the return on investment is just not worth it. That&#39;s the situation one of our teams has recently found themselves in.

The complexity of NLP and database management increases in this field, particularly while dealing with complex queries and database structures. In this post, we introduce a straightforward but powerful solution with accompanying code to text-to-SQL using a custom agent implementation along with Amazon Bedrock and Converse API.

            As AI development accelerates, developers need tools that let them move fast without having to reinvent their workflows. Docker Model Runner introduces a new specification for packaging large language models (LLMs) as OCI artifacts — a format developers already know and trust. It brings model sharing into the same workflows used for containers, with support...

            The last few years have made it clear that AI models will continue to be a fundamental component of many applications. The catch is that they’re also a fundamentally different type of component, with complex software and hardware requirements that don’t (yet) fit neatly into the constraints of container-oriented development lifecycles and architectures. To help...

            As developers, we often fall into common pitfalls that impact the performance, security, and scalability of our applications. From neglecting data validation to overengineering, and from ignoring async/await to mishandling resource disposal, even experienced C# developers can make these mistakes. In this post, I&#39;ve gathered some of

            In this post, we demonstrate how organizations can enhance their incident management capabilities by integrating PagerDuty Advance, an innovative set of agentic and generative AI capabilities that automate response workflows and provide real-time insights into operational health, with Amazon Q Business. We show how to configure PagerDuty Advance as a data accessor for Amazon Q indexes, so you can search and access enterprise knowledge across multiple systems during incident response.

            In the context of distributed systems and microservices architecture, orchestrating communication between diverse components presents significant challenges. However, with the launch of Amazon Bedrock Agents, the landscape is evolving, offering a simplified approach to agent creation and seamless integration of the return of control capability. In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Agents revolutionizes agent creation and demonstrates the efficacy of the return of control capability in orchestrating complex interactions between multiple systems.

            Understanding how your application behaves at runtime has always been a challenge. Traditional debugging and profiling tools can help you understand what’s happening at specific points in time – but getting a complete picture of system behavior, performance patterns, and architectural relationships often means jumping between external tools and dashboards. We’re building the OpenTelemetry plugin […]

            A common pattern for C callbacks is to accept a function pointer and a void*, and then the callback function receives that pointer in addition to the parameters specific to the callback. // Hypothetical callback typedef int (callback_t)( void context, int arg1, char const* arg2, double arg3); void Regi

            GitHub Actions doesn&#39;t provide a built-in way to rerun a run automatically. If you have some flakiness in your jobs, this can be a pain as you have to rerun the workflow manually. Hopefully, you can use the workflow_run event to trigger a new workflow when a previous one fails. This allows you to rerun the failed workflow automatically. Note that the following sample workflow will only rerun the failed…
