            In this post, we detail how Metagenomi partnered with AWS to implement the Progen2 protein language model on AWS Inferentia, achieving up to 56% cost reduction for high-throughput enzyme generation workflows. The implementation enabled cost-effective generation of millions of novel enzyme variants using EC2 Inf2 Spot Instances and AWS Batch, demonstrating how cloud-based generative AI can make large-scale protein design more accessible for biotechnology applications .

            Every developer eventually hits a wall with their local machine. Maybe it’s training an AI model that drains your CPU, compiling a massive codebase that makes your fan sound like a jet engine, or simply trying to run GPU workloads on a laptop that doesn’t have one. The result is the same: slow builds, limited...

            In this post, we walk through how to take an ML model built in SageMaker Canvas and deploy it using SageMaker Serverless Inference, helping you go from model creation to production-ready predictions quickly and efficiently without managing any infrastructure. This solution demonstrates a complete workflow from adding your trained model to the SageMaker Model Registry through creating serverless endpoint configurations and deploying endpoints that automatically scale based on demand .

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Sonic&#39;s speech-to-speech capabilities can be combined with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to create sophisticated multi-agent voice assistants that break complex tasks into specialized, manageable components. The approach demonstrates how to build modular, scalable voice applications using a banking assistant example with dedicated sub-agents for authentication, banking inquiries, and mortgage services, offering a more maintainable alternative to monolithic voice assistant designs.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to deploy and manage machine learning training workloads using the Amazon SageMaker HyperPod training operator, which enhances training resilience for Kubernetes workloads through pinpoint recovery and customizable monitoring capabilities. The Amazon SageMaker HyperPod training operator helps accelerate generative AI model development by efficiently managing distributed training across large GPU clusters, offering benefits like centralized training process monitoring, granular process recovery, and hanging job detection that can reduce recovery times from tens of minutes to seconds.

            Organizations often face challenges when implementing single-shot fine-tuning approaches for their generative AI models. The single-shot fine-tuning method involves selecting training data, configuring hyperparameters, and hoping the results meet expectations without the ability to make incremental adjustments. Single-shot fine-tuning frequently leads to suboptimal results and requires starting the entire process from scratch when improvements are […]

            The article demonstrates how to implement a secure MCP OAuth desktop client using Microsoft Entra ID. The MCP server is built with ASP.NET Core and secured using Microsoft Entra ID. The MCP client is a .NET console application that must acquire an OAuth access token to interact with the MCP server. Code: https://github.com/damienbod/McpSecurity Setup A […]

            In this post, we share four high-impact, widely adopted use cases built with Nova in Amazon Bedrock, supported by real-world customers deployments, offerings available from AWS partners, and experiences. These examples are ideal for organizations researching their own AI adoption strategies and use cases across industries.

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory transforms raw conversational data into persistent, actionable knowledge through sophisticated extraction, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms that mirror human cognitive processes. The system tackles the complex challenge of building AI agents that don&#39;t just store conversations but extract meaningful insights, merge related information across time, and maintain coherent memory stores that enable truly context-aware interactions.

            At Docker, we are building our hardened images to exacting standards. That means carefully crafting by hand, because humans are still the best security architects. That said, we understand the value of AI and deploy it as an extra set of eyes at critical junctures in our Docker Hardened Image (DHI) build process. With this...

            When managing reference counts, there is an asymmetry between incrementing and decrementing: Incrementing the reference count can use relaxed semantics, but decrementing requires release semantics (and destroying requires acquire semantics). The asymmetry may strike you as odd, but maybe it shouldn&#39;t. After all, it&#39;s not surprising

            The author reflects on their successful mid-1990s prediction that data ownership would dictate power. They discuss the present reality, where tech giants utilize data for profit and manipulation. Emphasizing personal data protection, they share practical habits for minimizing exposure and invite others to contribute their own safety tips.
