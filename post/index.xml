            dbt Core is a modern data transformation framework. It doesn’t extract or load data and is only responsible for the T in the ELT (extract-load-transform) process. dbt connects to your data warehouse and helps you prepare your data so it can later be used to answer business questions. In this blog post, we’ll talk about […]

            A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a list of components in a piece of software. It is a critical part of the software supply chain, as it helps to identify and track the components used in a software project. In this post, I describe how to easily generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for NuGet packages. To generate an SBOM for NuGet packages, you can use the Microsoft.Sbom.Targets package.

            Messaging systems are the backbone of scalable and distributed applications in .NET. They allow different parts of an application, or even separate applications, to communicate efficiently and reliably. Choosing the right messaging library, Rebus, NServiceBus, or MassTransit, is essential to ensure our system’s performance and long-term maintainability. In this article, we will compare Rebus, NServiceBus, […] The post Comparison of Rebus, NServiceBus, and MassTransit in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            Every article about modular monoliths tells you to use public APIs between modules, but they rarely explain why these APIs exist or how to design them properly. After building several large-scale modular monoliths, I&#39;ve learned that public APIs are not just about clean code - they&#39;re about controlling chaos.

            Ensemble models are becoming popular within the ML communities. They generate more accurate predictions through combining the predictions of multiple models. Pipelines can quickly be used to create and end-to-end ML pipeline for ensemble models. This enables developers to build highly accurate models while maintaining efficiency, and reproducibility. In this post, we provide an example of an ensemble model that was trained and deployed using Pipelines.

            In this post, we explore a solution for implementing load balancing across login nodes in Slurm-based HyperPod clusters. By distributing user activity evenly across all available nodes, this approach provides more consistent performance, better resource utilization, and a smoother experience for all users. We guide you through the setup process, providing practical steps to achieve effective load balancing in your HyperPod clusters.

In this post, we show you how agentic workflows with Amazon Bedrock Agents can help accelerate this journey for research scientists with a natural language interface. We define an example analysis pipeline, specifically for lung cancer survival with clinical, genomics, and imaging modalities of biomarkers. We showcase a variety of specialized agents including a biomarker database analyst, statistician, clinical evidence researcher, and medical imaging expert in collaboration with a supervisor agent.

            In Part 1 of this series, we introduced the newly launched ModelTrainer class on the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK and its benefits, and showed you how to fine-tune a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model on a custom dataset. In this post, we look at the enhancements to the ModelBuilder class, which lets you seamlessly deploy a model from ModelTrainer to a SageMaker endpoint, and provides a single interface for multiple deployment configurations.

            In this post, we illustrate the importance of generative AI in the collaboration between Tealium and the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) team by automating the following: 1/ Evaluating the retriever and the generated answer of a RAG system based on the Ragas Repository powered by Amazon Bedrock, 2/ Generating improved instructions for each question-and-answer pair using an automatic prompt engineering technique based on the Auto-Instruct Repository. An instruction refers to a general direction or command given to the model to guide generation of a response.
