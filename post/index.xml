            In this article, we are going to learn about integrating Keycloak authentication in a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) frontend and a .NET Web API backend. With this setup, we will enable secure user authentication across both applications. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication, authorization, and user management out of the […] The post Keycloak Authentication With ASP.NET Core Web API and Blazor WebAssembly appeared first on Code Maze.

            This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per […]

            I has a scenario where I needed to configure an Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server to use Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication and add the Entra user running the HashiCorp Terraform deployment as the Azure PostgreSQL Administrator using the azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server_active_directory_administrator Terraform resource. Generally, you would use the azuread_user data resource in Terraform to get the Entra […] The article Terraform: Get User Principal Name (UPN) of User Running Deployment without Entra ID Read Permissions was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving at a rapid pace, with machine learning techniques becoming more sophisticated and efficient. One of the biggest challenges in traditional AI training is the heavy reliance on labeled datasets, which require extensive human effort and resources. However, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is revolutionizing the field by enabling AI models to learn […] The article Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in AI Systems: Autonomous Machine Intelligence was originally published on Build5Nines.

            While offset pagination is widely used, cursor-based pagination offers significant performance advantages - my tests show a 17x speedup when paginating through a million-record dataset in PostgreSQL. Let&#39;s take a deep dive into cursor pagination, compare it with offset pagination, and examine the SQL execution plans.

            本文翻译自 Máňa, Natalia 和 Anton 创作的 .NET 9 Networking Improvements 秉承我们的传统，我们很高兴与您分享这篇博客文章，以介绍新的 .NET 版本中网络领域相关的最新动态和最有趣的变化。今年，我们带来了 HTTP 领域的改变、新的 HttpClientFactory API、.NET Framework 兼容性优化等更多内容。 HTTP 在接下来的部分中，我们将介绍 HTTP 领域最具影响力的变化。其中包括连接池的性能优化、对多个HTTP/3连接的支持、Windows代理的自动更新，以及重要的社区贡献。 连接池 在此版本中，我们对HTTP连接池进行了两项显著的性能优化。 我们增加了对多个HTTP/3连接的可选支持。根据RFC 9114标准文档，由于连接可以多路复用并行请求，因此不鼓励使用多个HTTP/3连接到对等端。然而，在某些场景下，例如服务器到服务器的通信，即使请求多路复用，单一连接也可能成为瓶颈。我们在 HTTP/2 中看到了这样的限制（dotnet/runtime#35088），它同样具有在单一连接上多路复用的概念。出于同样的原因（dotnet/runtime#51775），我们决定为HTTP/3实现多连接支持（dotnet/runtime#101535）。 该实现本身尽可能贴近 HTTP/2 多连接机制的行为。当前，它的策略是优先填充已有连接，直到达到对端允许的请求上限后，才会创建新的连接。不过，需要注意的是，这是一个具体的实现细节，该行为在未来可能会有所变化。 结果是，我们的基准测试显示每秒请求数（RPS）有显著提升，以下是10,000个并行请求的对比结果： 客户端 单 HTTP/3 连接 多 HTTP/3 连接 最大CPU使用率(%) 35 92 最大核心使用率(%) 971 2572 最大工作集(MB) 3810 6491 最大私有内存(MB) 4415 7228 处理器数量 28 28 […]

            Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used.

            In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing.

Instead, it explicitly ensures that the object remains referenced at a specific point in the code after it’s last used. It’s particularly useful when dealing with […]

            String concatenation in .NET can be optimized by using the Span type to enhance performance and reduce memory usage. By replacing traditional methods with AsSpan() and string.Concat(), memory allocations decrease significantly, yielding substantial performance gains. Adhering to best practices helps identify and rectify inefficient concatenation patterns.

            The mission of Rich Data Co (RDC) is to broaden access to sustainable credit globally. Its software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution empowers leading banks and lenders with deep customer insights and AI-driven decision-making capabilities. In this post, we discuss how RDC uses generative AI on Amazon Bedrock to build these assistants and accelerate its overall mission of democratizing access to sustainable credit.

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can deploy an LLM such as DeepSeek-R1—or another FM of your choice—from popular model hubs like SageMaker JumpStart or Hugging Face Hub to SageMaker AI for real-time inference. We explore inference frameworks like Hugging Face TGI which helps streamline deployment while integrating built-in performance optimizations to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Additionally, we showcase how the SageMaker developer-friendly Python SDK simplifies endpoint orchestration, allowing seamless experimentation and scaling of LLM-powered applications.

This allows me to easily validate what EF is doing behind the scenes and ensures that no attributes are missed, such as accidentally using nvarchar(max). My main objectives are: Be notified when the schema changes Review the new schema while editing it and during code reviews The solution I use is use is to have a test that…

            In this article, we’ll introduce hybrid caching in .NET, a new cache type that bridges the existing cache mechanisms in .NET: distributed cache and memory cache. We’ll start by briefly explaining a cache and how existing caches in .NET work. After that, we’ll explore hybrid caching and show how it can be used and configured […] The post Hybrid Caching in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.
