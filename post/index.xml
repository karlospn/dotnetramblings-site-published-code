            Views are central to Django’s architecture pattern, and having a solid grasp of how to work with them is essential for any developer working with the framework. If you’re new to developing web apps with Django or just need a refresher on views, we’ve got you covered. Gaining a better understanding of views will help […]

            RAG retrieves data from a preexisting knowledge base (your data), combines it with the LLM’s knowledge, and generates responses with more human-like language. However, in order for generative AI to understand your data, some amount of data preparation is required, which involves a big learning curve. In this post, we walk you through how to convert your existing Aurora data into an index without needing data preparation for Amazon Kendra to perform data search and implement RAG that combines your data along with LLM knowledge to produce accurate responses.

      <description>
        
          
            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference can help address the challenges of maintaining responsiveness in LLM applications. We&#39;ll dive deep into strategies for optimizing application performance and improving user experience. Whether you&#39;re building a new AI application or optimizing an existing one, you&#39;ll find practical guidance on both the technical aspects of latency optimization and real-world implementation approaches. We begin by explaining latency in LLM applications.

            I happened to see this post from Milan Jovanović today about a little backlash to the MediatR library. For my part, I think MediatR is just a victim of its own success and any backlash is mostly due to folks misusing it very badly in unnecessarily complicated ways (that’s my experience). That aside, yes, I … Continue reading Wolverine for MediatR Users →

The Prithvi model is a first-of-its-kind temporal Vision transformer pre-trained by the IBM and NASA team on contiguous US Harmonised Landsat Sentinel 2 (HLS) data. It can be finetuned for image segmentation using the mmsegmentation library for use cases like burn scars detection, flood mapping, and multi-temporal crop classification.

            The article analyzes performance issues in .NET code using SortedDictionary. It recommends using Dictionary for single sorting needs and compares various sorting techniques. Benchmark results reveal that sorting keys separately and iterating is fastest, while SortedDictionary excels with foreach loops. Careful choice of dictionary type affects performance and memory allocation.

            The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern, which is commonly discussed today, is based on the foundational idea that the retrieval part is done using vector search. This ensures that all the most relevant information available to answer the given question is returned and then fed to an LLM to generate the final answer. While vector […]

            In this post, we show you how to set up Amazon Lex for an omnichannel chatbot experience and Amazon Bedrock to be your secondary validation layer. This allows your customers to potentially provide out-of-band responses both at the intent and slot collection levels without having to be re-prompted, allowing for a seamless customer experience.

            Whether during application startup, multi-step workflows, or monitoring an application’s overall health, verifying database connectivity is essential for smooth operation and graceful handling of potential failures. It improves reliability and the overall user experience. In modern containerized environments, often managed by orchestrators like Kubernetes (K8S), it’s equally important for services to report their health status.

            Today, we’re excited to announce multi-turn conversation with an agent node (preview), a powerful new capability in Flows. This new capability enhances the agent node functionality, enabling dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue in a flow execution.

            In this post, we show you an innovative solution to a challenge faced by security teams in highly regulated industries: the efficient security analysis of vast amounts of video recordings from Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems. We demonstrate how you can use Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of models and Amazon Bedrock to perform the complex task of analyzing video recordings of server console sessions and perform queries to highlight any potential security anomalies.
