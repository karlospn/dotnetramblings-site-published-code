            On November 24, 2025, Docker Hardened Images resolved CVE-2025-12735 in the Kibana project, which is the visualization and user interface layer for Elasticsearch. This CVE is a critical remote code execution vulnerability that scored 9.8 on the CVSS scale. While images from other hardened image vendors were still carrying the vulnerability, Docker’s security team and...

            Spring’s AOT engine has been around since the Spring Native days, but Spring Data never really benefited from it – until now. Repository infrastructure is one of the most dynamic parts of the framework, and for years it relied heavily on proxies, reflection, and queries generated at runtime. That flexibility has a price: it slows […]

            We&#39;re introducing bidirectional streaming for Amazon SageMaker AI Inference, which transforms inference from a transactional exchange into a continuous conversation. This post shows you how to build and deploy a container with bidirectional streaming capability to a SageMaker AI endpoint. We also demonstrate how you can bring your own container or use our partner Deepgram&#39;s pre-built models and containers on SageMaker AI to enable bi-directional streaming feature for real-time inference.

            Naming resources in Azure shouldn’t feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. Yet, without a solid standard, names can quickly become inconsistent, confusing, and downright chaotic. The result? A messy Azure environment that’s hard to search, manage, and govern. This guide will show you exactly how to establish and enforce Azure naming conventions using the open source Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform module — […] The article How To Automate Azure Naming Conventions with the Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform Module was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we introduce the Multi-Provider Generative AI Gateway reference architecture, which provides guidance for deploying LiteLLM into an AWS environment to streamline the management and governance of production generative AI workloads across multiple model providers. This centralized gateway solution addresses common enterprise challenges including provider fragmentation, decentralized governance, operational complexity, and cost management by offering a unified interface that supports Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and external providers while maintaining comprehensive security, monitoring, and control capabilities.

            In this post, you&#39;ll learn how to deploy geospatial AI agents that can answer complex spatial questions in minutes instead of months. By combining Foursquare Spatial H3 Hub&#39;s analysis-ready geospatial data with reasoning models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can build agents that enable nontechnical domain experts to perform sophisticated spatial analysis through natural language queries—without requiring geographic information system (GIS) expertise or custom data engineering pipelines.

            Mark Lechner, Docker’s CISO, shares his vision for a future where Docker not only powers the software supply chain, but actively safeguards it. Cybersecurity has reached a turning point. The most significant threats no longer exploit isolated systems; they move through the connections between them. The modern attack surface includes every dependency, every container, and...

            In this post you will learn how to use Spectrum to optimize resource use and shorten training times without sacrificing quality, as well as how to implement Spectrum fine-tuning with Amazon SageMaker AI training jobs. We will also discuss the tradeoff between QLoRA and Spectrum fine-tuning, showing that while QLoRA is more resource efficient, Spectrum results in higher performance overall.

            Say you need to transfer a large amount of data between two processes. One way is to use shared memory. Is that the fastest way to do it? Can you do any better? One argument against shared memory is that the sender will have to copy the data into the shared memory block, and the recipient will have to copy it out, resulting in two e

            Ever year or so, a new version of .NET ships, and I need to upgrade the .NET SDK version on my machines. Not just the Windows machines, but also the WSL Ubuntu bits that live on those same machines. First, determine what version of dotnet you already have using this:
1 2
dotnet --version
10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107
Yep, I need to update that. But how? Surely there must be a simple way to do it using just the command line.

            The era of AI agents has arrived, and with it, a new standard for how they connect to tools: the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP unlocks powerful, flexible workflows by letting agents tap into external tools and systems. But with thousands of MCP servers (including remote ones) now available, it’s easy to ask: Where do...
