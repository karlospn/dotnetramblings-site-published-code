            In this post, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration pipeline for processing unstructured insurance data using Amazon Bedrock, featuring specialized agents for classification, conversion, and metadata extraction. We demonstrate how this domain-aware approach transforms diverse data formats like claims documents, videos, and audio files into metadata-rich outputs that enable fraud detection, customer 360-degree views, and advanced analytics.

Over 30% of developers tend to deploy Java workloads with no JVM configuration at all, therefore relying on the default settings of the HotSpot JVM. The default settings in OpenJDK are intentionally conservative, designed to work across […]

            HERE collaborated with the GenAIIC. Our joint mission was to create an intelligent AI coding assistant that could provide explanations and executable code solutions in response to users’ natural language queries. The requirement was to build a scalable system that could translate natural language questions into HTML code with embedded JavaScript, ready for immediate rendering as an interactive map that users can see on screen.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a custom plugin with Amazon Q Business for backend integration. This plugin can integrate existing systems, including third-party systems, with little to no development in just weeks and automate critical workflows. Additionally, we show how to safeguard the solution using Amazon Cognito and AWS IAM Identity Center, maintaining the safety and integrity of sensitive data and workflows.

            Codex is a cloud-based coding agent. Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI o3 optimized for software engineering. codex-1 was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and iteratively runs tests until passing results are achieved.

            A 18‑year chronicle of Apple’s mobile powerhouse—how it began, how it rewired the software economy, and why its next act is infused with on‑device intelligence. You wake up, glance at a glowing rectangle, and with a tap summon everything from bank balances to baby photos. That daily ritual traces its lineage to a January 2007 […] The article Software Innovations: iOS – The Operating System That Put the Future in Your Pocket was originally published on Build5Nines.

      <title>Cloud infrastructure provisioning: best practices for IaC</title>

            Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is a common DevOps practice that enterprises use to provision and deploy IT infrastructure. Enterprises applying IaC and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines can maintain high availability and manage risk for their cloud environments at scale. However, multi-environment challenges, manual processes, and fragmented guidance still lead to configuration drift, errors, and inconsistencies. These issues are likely to result in downtime, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource utilization.
