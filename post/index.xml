            In this post, we walk you through how to build a hybrid search solution using OpenSearch Service powered by multimodal embeddings from the Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 model through Amazon Bedrock. This solution demonstrates how you can enable users to submit both text and images as queries to retrieve relevant results from a sample retail image dataset.

            Introduction In October 2024 Microsoft replaced a legacy rule‑based chat bot on Microsoft Store with Microsoft Store Assistant, powered by Azure Open AI, Semantic Kernel, and real‑time page context. The transformation changed a scripted, button-driven experience into a conversation that comprehends the entire public Microsoft portfolio, including Surface and Xbox products, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, Azure services, and the Dynamics and Power Platform […]

            In this post, we explore two approaches for securing sensitive data in RAG applications using Amazon Bedrock. The first approach focused on identifying and redacting sensitive data before ingestion into an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and the second demonstrated a fine-grained RBAC pattern for managing access to sensitive information during retrieval. These solutions represent just two possible approaches among many for securing sensitive data in generative AI applications.

            Spring Framework 6.2 introduced MockMvcTester to support writing AssertJ style assertions using AssertJ under the hood. If you’re using Spring Boot, the spring-boot-starter-test dependency transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as mockito, assertj, json-path, jsonassert, etc. So, if you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 (which uses Spring framework 6.2) or any later version, […]

            In this post, we explore the importance of evaluating LLMs in the context of generative AI applications, highlighting the challenges posed by issues like hallucinations and biases. We introduced a comprehensive solution using AWS services to automate the evaluation process, allowing for continuous monitoring and assessment of LLM performance. By using tools like the FMeval Library, Ragas, LLMeter, and Step Functions, the solution provides flexibility and scalability, meeting the evolving needs of LLM consumers.

            When building Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM-based solutions, the quality and structure of input data significantly influences the performance of the LLM models. PDF documents, a prevalent format for information dissemination, often contain rich textual content that can be harnessed for such applications. However, extracting this content in a structured and usable format […] The article Extract Text from PDF Files with Python for use in Generative AI and RAG Solutions was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Microsoft Learn has a growing list of Power Platform training modules. Based on community feedback, we’ve added a new learning path: Work with Power Fx functions. Power Fx functions enable the creation of server-side business logic using Power Fx, a low-code, declarative language. These functions were previously called instant low-code plug-ins. They provide reusable, parameterized […]

            This article analyzes the performance of different methods for retrieving the character count of a string in .NET, recommending the use of Length as the fastest option. Length is significantly more efficient than Span and Enumerable.Count(), urging developers to refactor for improved performance while validating optimizations with BenchmarkDotNet.

BDA extracts structured outputs from unstructured content—including documents, images, video, and audio—while alleviating the need for complex custom workflows. In this post, we demonstrate how BDA automatically extracts rich video insights such as chapter segments and audio segments, detects text in scenes, and classifies Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomies, and then uses these insights to build a nonlinear ads solution to enhance contextual advertising effectiveness.
