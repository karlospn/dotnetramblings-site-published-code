            Performing base 10 conversions is fundamental when learning basic computer science and mathematical concepts. Since we know computer systems understand binary, such conversions can help us form different number representations that we can use for various applications such as encoding and cryptography.

            本文翻译于David Pine的这篇文章：Refactor your C# code with primary constructors 作为 .NET 8 一部分的 C# 12 引入了一组引人注目的新功能！ 在这篇文章中，我们将探讨其中一个功能，特别是主构造函数，解释其用法和相关性。 然后，我们将演示一个重构示例，以展示如何将其应用到您的代码中，并讨论其好处和潜在的缺陷。 这将帮助您了解这一更改的影响并有助于您决定是否采用该功能。 主构造函数1️⃣ 主构造函数被认为是一项“C#日常”的开发人员功能。 它们允许您在一个简洁的声明中定义类或结构及其构造函数。 这可以帮助您减少需要编写的样板代码量。 如果您一直在关注 C# 版本，您可能熟悉记录类型，其中包括主构造函数的第一个示例。 与记录类型的区别 记录类型作为类或结构的类型修饰符引入，这简化了构建简单类（如数据容器）的语法。 记录可以包括主构造函数。 该构造函数不仅生成一个支持字段，而且还为每个参数公开一个公共属性。 与传统的类或结构类型不同，在传统的类或结构类型中，主构造函数参数可以在整个类定义中访问，而记录被设计为透明的数据容器。 他们本质上支持基于值的相等，这与他们作为数据持有者的预期角色相一致。 因此，它们的主构造函数参数可以作为属性访问是合乎逻辑的。 重构示例✨ .NET 提供了许多模板，如果您曾经创建过Worker Service，您可能见过以下Worker类模板代码： namespace Example.Worker.Service { public class Worker : BackgroundService { private readonly ILogger

            In this article, we’ll explore HttpClient’s delegating handlers in ASP.NET Core. These handlers act as a middleware pipeline for HTTP requests and responses, allowing us to intercept, process, and modify HTTP traffic before it reaches external applications. What Are Delegating Handlers? Delegating Handlers in HttpClient closely resembles ASP.NET Core’s middleware architecture. Each handler processes incoming […] The post Using Delegating Handlers to Extend HttpClient in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

            This content explains the usage of Enums in programming, cautioning against relying solely on Enum values for human-readable names from databases due to potential performance issues. It introduces EnumHelper and EnumExtensions in Spargine, providing methods like GetValues() and GetDescription(). The article also discusses the Enumeration class as a solution to surpass Enum limitations, offering flexibility for custom names and methods like FromDisplayName. This extends Enum functionality and provides more versatility when Enum&#39;s constraints are exceeded.

            The article advocates for initializing reference type static fields inline to enhance code readability and prevent unexpected behavior caused by uninitialized static fields. Microsoft recommends initializing these fields at the point of declaration to improve clarity. The article provides examples demonstrating the issue and the recommended solution, emphasizing the use of static constructors for initialization.

            Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for large language models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity due to their ability to increase model capacity and computational efficiency compared to fully dense models. By utilizing sparse expert subnetworks that process different subsets of tokens, MoE models can effectively increase the number of parameters while requiring less computation per […]

            In this post, we present a new approach named multimodal RAG (mmRAG) to tackle those existing limitations in greater detail. The solution intends to address these limitations for practical generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistant use cases. Additionally, we examine potential solutions to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) with advanced LangChain capabilities, enabling them to generate more comprehensive, coherent, and accurate outputs while effectively handling multimodal data

By using the new performance optimizations of LoRA techniques in SageMaker large model inference (LMI) containers along with inference components, we demonstrate how organizations can efficiently manage and serve their growing portfolio of fine-tuned models, while optimizing costs and providing seamless performance for their customers. The latest SageMaker LMI container offers unmerged-LoRA inference, sped up with our LMI-Dist inference engine and OpenAI style chat schema.

            The article discusses the use of expression-bodied methods in .NET as an alternative to traditional methods for creating simple functions. It presents a comparison between the two methods in terms of syntax and performance. Despite the syntactical differences, benchmark results show that both methods demonstrate similar performance characteristics.
