            In 2024, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched the Generative AI Accelerator Challenge (GENIAC)—a Japanese national program to boost generative AI by providing companies with funding, mentorship, and massive compute resources for foundation model (FM) development. AWS was selected as the cloud provider for GENIAC’s second cycle (cycle 2). It provided infrastructure and technical guidance for 12 participating organizations.

            Integration testing has always presented a fundamental challenge: how do you test your application against real dependencies without the complexity of managing external services? Traditional approaches often involve either mocking dependencies (which can miss integration issues) or maintaining separate test environments (which can be expensive

            When developing a Roslyn Source Generator, it&#39;s important to verify that it works as intended. There are several approaches to testing: you can compare the generated code output (for example, with snapshot testing), or you can go further and ensure that the generated code behaves correctly when executed. In this post, I&#39;ll show example for both ways. Note that I strongly recommend to use the second…

            I’ve always considered myself a pragmatic technologist—someone who loves technology not for its own sake, but for the direct impact it can have on people’s lives. That’s what makes this job so exciting, since I believe AI will unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history. If we get this right, AI can give everyone more power than ever.

            CollectionRandomizer is a new utility class for .NET that simplifies working with randomized collections. It supports infinite looping and automatic reshuffling, making it ideal for dynamic UI components and rotating messages. This lightweight, thread-safe class is production-ready and streamlines the process of retrieving random items efficiently.

To create this new implementation, the classic terminal was rewritten almost from scratch to provide the technical foundation for new terminal features like visual separation of executed commands, AI integration, and the ability to work seamlessly in remote development scenarios. Functionally, it is […]

            Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) goes beyond statistical metrics like perplexity or bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores. For most real-world generative AI scenarios, it’s crucial to understand whether a model is producing better outputs than a baseline or an earlier iteration. This is especially important for applications such as summarization, content generation, […]

            At JetBrains, we care about Kotlin compiler quality. One powerful way to test it? Fuzzing, an approach that feeds programs unexpected, often random, inputs to uncover bugs that traditional tests may miss. It may sound chaotic, but it works, especially for complex software like compilers. In a previous post, our colleagues introduced kotlinx.fuzz, a powerful […]

            Organizations are adopting large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek R1, to transform business processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation at unprecedented speed. However, standalone LLMs have key limitations such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and no access to proprietary data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these gaps by combining semantic search with generative AI, […]

By combining the Vonage Voice API with the low-latency and expressive speech capabilities of Amazon Nova Sonic, businesses can deploy AI voice agents that deliver more human-like interactions than traditional voice interfaces. These agents can be used as customer support, virtual assistants, and more.

            AI is no longer a distant idea. It’s already here and changing how we build software. As it advances, new questions emerge about its impact. How deeply will AI be woven into software development? What new opportunities will emerge for companies building AI-powered tools? Perhaps most importantly, how will developers and AI collaborate over the […]

            At Docker, we always believe in the power of community and collaboration. It reminds me of what Robert Axelrod said in The Evolution of Cooperation: “The key to doing well lies not in overcoming others, but in eliciting their cooperation.” And what better place for Docker Model Runner to foster this cooperation than at Hugging...

            The author reflects on the vital role of the software community in shaping their career as an engineer, emphasizing its decline post-COVID-19. They highlight the diminishing local user groups and conferences, attributing this to a lack of appreciation from younger developers and reduced corporate support, particularly from Microsoft. A call to action urges developers to engage, companies to invest, and veterans to mentor, reinforcing the importance of community in fostering quality software.
