            Azure DevOps will no longer depend on the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) resource (https://management.azure.com) when you sign in or refresh Microsoft Entra access tokens. Previously, Azure DevOps required the ARM audience during sign-in and token refresh flows. This requirement meant administrators had to allow all Azure DevOps users to bypa

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock Agents to solve complex business questions in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show how specialized agents in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), legal, and finance domains can work together to provide comprehensive business insights by analyzing data from multiple sources.

            AI is changing software development — but not how you think The hype is real, but so are the challenges. Here&#39;s what developers, teams, and tech leaders need to know about AI’s uneven, evolving role in software. Rumors of AI’s pervasiveness in software development have been greatly exaggerated. A look under the hood shows adoption...

            Spring Boot is a marvel of developer productivity. It hides the plumbing and gets you up and running fast. Components are “miraculously” autowired, properties are “magically” resolved, and database connections materialize seemingly without explicit configuration. But when something goes wrong, the magic becomes a mystery, and debugging becomes a deep dive into the framework’s internal […]

            User Experience (UX) focuses on the emotional and practical interactions users have with software. It emphasizes designing with the user in mind, which is often overlooked by engineers and managers. Effective UX involves usability, accessibility, performance, and more. Improving UX enhances user satisfaction, loyalty, and overall product success in software development.

            In November 2023, Broadcom acquired VMware for a whopping USD 69 billion. The strategic goal behind the acquisition was to enable customers to create and modernize their cloud environments, both private and hybrid. Following the acquisition, VMware perpetual license holders started receiving cease-and-desist letters from Broadcom. Users can continue using the software, but can no […]

            Amazon SageMaker Canvas offers no-code solutions that simplify data wrangling, making time series forecasting accessible to all users regardless of their technical background. In this post, we explore how SageMaker Canvas and SageMaker Data Wrangler provide no-code data preparation techniques that empower users of all backgrounds to prepare data and build time series forecasting models in a single interface with confidence.

            In this post, we demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds.

            Some applications are displaying sensitive information. With Recall, Windows can take a screenshot of your screen regularly and store sensitive information. You can exclude your application from this feature, and screen capture more generally, by using SetWindowDisplayAffinity and the WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE flag. This is a Windows API function that allows you to set the display affinity of a window, which…

            The EU AI Act establishes comprehensive regulations for AI development and deployment within the EU. AWS is committed to building trust in AI through various initiatives including being among the first signatories of the EU&#39;s AI Pact, providing AI Service Cards and guardrails, and offering educational resources while helping customers understand their responsibilities under the new regulatory framework.

            In this post, we discuss how SageMaker HyperPod and SageMaker Studio can improve and speed up the development experience of data scientists by using IDEs and tooling of SageMaker Studio and the scalability and resiliency of SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS. The solution simplifies the setup for the system administrator of the centralized system by using the governance and security capabilities offered by the AWS services.

            At Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering, we are big fans of integration tests. They are the best way to test that your system works as a whole, but sometimes, integration tests are overkill or too complex to set up that the return on investment is just not worth it. That&#39;s the situation one of our teams has recently found themselves in.

      <title>Why Docker Chose OCI Artifacts for AI Model Packaging</title>

            As AI development accelerates, developers need tools that let them move fast without having to reinvent their workflows. Docker Model Runner introduces a new specification for packaging large language models (LLMs) as OCI artifacts — a format developers already know and trust. It brings model sharing into the same workflows used for containers, with support...

            The last few years have made it clear that AI models will continue to be a fundamental component of many applications. The catch is that they’re also a fundamentally different type of component, with complex software and hardware requirements that don’t (yet) fit neatly into the constraints of container-oriented development lifecycles and architectures. To help...

            As AI tools continue to advance and become bigger parts of our lives, it is important to think critically about AI interactions. At JetBrains, the Developer Experience (DX) and Human-AI eXperience (HAX) study this, with a particular interest in enhancing these interactions in code-related tasks. In this post we will look at how our teams […]

            We study how training on incorrect responses can cause broader misalignment in language models and identify an internal feature driving this behavior—one that can be reversed with minimal fine-tuning.

            This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a popular practice in modern DevOps security and automation workflows. By treating infrastructure as code, teams can automate resource provisioning and deployments and significantly reduce efforts spent on manual configurations. However, just as with application code, IaC configurations can introduce […]
