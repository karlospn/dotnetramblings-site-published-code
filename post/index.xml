            Introduction This blog post highlights a recent collaboration between Microsoft and Alice &amp;amp; Bob, a French startup whose goal is to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer by leveraging a superconducting qubit called a cat qubit. In this collaboration, Alice &amp;amp; Bob uses the new extensibility mechanisms of Microsoft’s Resource Estimator to obtain resource estimates for their cat qubit architecture.

            If you’re not familiar with it, Lamar is an IoC/DI container for .NET. It was originally built to be a faster, modernized, ASP.Net Core-compliant replacement for the much older StructureMap IoC library and also as a necessary subsystem of what is now Wolverine. First off, if you have a vested investment in continuing to use … Continue reading Retiring Lamar and the Ghost of IoC Containers Past →

            In software development, logging, and unit testing serve as foundational tools, each actively contributing to the reliability and functionality of our applications. While unit testing promptly alerts us to changes in our application’s business logic, logging actively monitors errors, performance metrics, and runtime execution flow. Despite their significance, many development workflows often overlook their incorporation.

            This post presents a solution that uses a generative artificial intelligence (AI) to standardize air quality data from low-cost sensors in Africa, specifically addressing the air quality data integration problem of low-cost sensors. The solution harnesses the capabilities of generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to address the challenges posed by diverse sensor data and automatically generate Python functions based on various data formats. The fundamental objective is to build a manufacturer-agnostic database, leveraging generative AI’s ability to standardize sensor outputs, synchronize data, and facilitate precise corrections.
