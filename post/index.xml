            In this blog post, we will provide some guidelines on how to mitigate prompt injection attacks in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and share the steps Microsoft has taken to address emerging risks such as this one for our customers. MCP is an open protocol spearheaded by Anthropic that defines a standardized interface for connecting Large […]

            In this post, we demonstrate model customization (fine-tuning) for tool use with Amazon Nova. We first introduce a tool usage use case, and gave details about the dataset. We walk through the details of Amazon Nova specific data formatting and showed how to do tool calling through the Converse and Invoke APIs in Amazon Bedrock. After getting the baseline results from Amazon Nova models, we explain in detail the fine-tuning process, hosting fine-tuned models with provisioned throughput, and using the fine-tuned Amazon Nova models for inference.

            In this post, we introduced the Open Source Bedrock Agent Evaluation framework, a Langfuse-integrated solution that streamlines the agent development process. We demonstrated how this evaluation framework can be integrated with pharmaceutical research agents. We used it to evaluate agent performance against biomarker questions and sent traces to Langfuse to view evaluation metrics across question types.

            When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), generating structured outputs like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is invaluable for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and integration with spreadsheet applications. However, since LLMs are primarily optimized for natural language generation, crafting prompts that yield valid CSV-formatted data requires careful engineering. This article provides strategies and examples to […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid CSV Data was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we explore two approaches for securing sensitive data in RAG applications using Amazon Bedrock. The first approach focused on identifying and redacting sensitive data before ingestion into an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and the second demonstrated a fine-grained RBAC pattern for managing access to sensitive information during retrieval. These solutions represent just two possible approaches among many for securing sensitive data in generative AI applications.

            Introduction Until now, iOS developers who wanted real‑time, bi‑directional communication with SignalR had to rely on community‑built clients or roll their own Swift implementation—both of which introduced maintenance and compatibility headaches. We’re excited to announce that the official SignalR Swift client is now available in public preview. With this release, you can: Quickly add real‑time […]

            Spring Framework 6.2 introduced MockMvcTester to support writing AssertJ style assertions using AssertJ under the hood. If you’re using Spring Boot, the spring-boot-starter-test dependency transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as mockito, assertj, json-path, jsonassert, etc. So, if you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 (which uses Spring framework 6.2) or any later version, […]

            In this post, we explore the importance of evaluating LLMs in the context of generative AI applications, highlighting the challenges posed by issues like hallucinations and biases. We introduced a comprehensive solution using AWS services to automate the evaluation process, allowing for continuous monitoring and assessment of LLM performance. By using tools like the FMeval Library, Ragas, LLMeter, and Step Functions, the solution provides flexibility and scalability, meeting the evolving needs of LLM consumers.

            Introduction In the first part of our series on Azure Cosmos DB Vector Search with DiskANN, we explored the fundamentals of vector indexing and search capabilities using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and demonstrated a few early performance and cost characteristics. In Part 2, we’ll demonstrate how to scale to 1 billion vector datasets, while […]

            OpenAI recently introduced a powerful new feature for developers: structured output using JSON Schema via the response_format parameter. This makes it possible to request responses from a GPT-4o model that strictly match a given schema—no free-text, no guesswork. If you’re working with Azure SQL, this is a game-changer. Combined with the sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint stored procedure and […]

            When building Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM-based solutions, the quality and structure of input data significantly influences the performance of the LLM models. PDF documents, a prevalent format for information dissemination, often contain rich textual content that can be harnessed for such applications. However, extracting this content in a structured and usable format […] The article Extract Text from PDF Files with Python for use in Generative AI and RAG Solutions was originally published on Build5Nines.

            This blog implements client assertions using an OAuth client credential flow in ASP.NET Core. Client assertions provide a secure way for client authentication without sharing a secret, enhancing the security the OAuth client credentials flow. By using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) client assertions, this approach ensures strong client identity (application) verification and mitigates risks associated […]
