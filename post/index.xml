            Did you know? In C#, you can use a feature called “caller info attributes” to obtain information about the caller of a method. This can be incredibly useful for logging, debugging, or tracing. The attributes CallerMemberName, CallerFilePath, and CallerLineNumber provide information such as the name of the calling method, the path to the source file […]

            The post highlights a decline in Microsoft .NET&#39;s presence in job listings while advocating for companies that still utilize it, such as Ardent Mills, GEICO, and Peloton. It also notes companies that do not use .NET, promoting awareness of diverse technology stacks. Community support for these organizations is encouraged to sustain .NET&#39;s relevance.

            We’re excited to announce the open source release of AWS MCP Servers for code assistants — a suite of specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that bring Amazon Web Services (AWS) best practices directly to your development workflow. This post is the first in a series covering AWS MCP Servers. In this post, we walk through how these specialized MCP servers can dramatically reduce your development time while incorporating security controls, cost optimizations, and AWS Well-Architected best practices into your code.

            This tutorial was brought to you by Rajkumar Venkatasamy, draft.dev. Microservice architecture has become a cornerstone for building scalable and maintainable applications. Microservices allow individual services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, resulting in faster delivery cycles and improved fault isolation. For example, an e-commerce platform can use independent services to handle product catalogs, […]

            In applications such as personalized recommendations and scientific research, accurately identifying the closest data points to a given query is crucial. Traditional methods like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search offer faster retrieval times by approximating results but may sacrifice accuracy, leading to potential errors in scenarios where precision is essential. This trade-off between speed and […]

            I&#39;m pleased to announce my latest Pluralsight course, Refactor and Optimize Code with GitHub Copilot, has just gone live. It will be part of a series of courses covering various aspects of using GitHub Copilot, and my course focuses specifically on using Copilot to refactor, modernize and optimize code. This is an important topic as many of us are spending a lot of time working on existing legacy codebases, and learning to use GenAI effectively with these projects is a great investment of your time.

            The [ConstantExpected] attribute in .NET enhances code analysis by indicating that methods or parameters require compile-time constants. It helps improve performance, catch inefficiencies, and reduce CA1856 warnings. A practical example in the Spargine project shows its impact. Integrating this attribute can yield significant performance benefits for developers.

            When implementing machine learning workflows in Amazon SageMaker Canvas, organizations might need to consider external dependencies required for their specific use cases. Although SageMaker Canvas provides powerful no-code and low-code capabilities for rapid experimentation, some projects might require specialized dependencies and libraries that aren’t included by default in SageMaker Canvas. This post provides an example of how to incorporate code that relies on external dependencies into your SageMaker Canvas workflows.

            In this post, we explore how you can use Amazon Bedrock to generate high-quality categorical ground truth data, which is crucial for training machine learning (ML) models in a cost-sensitive environment. Generative AI solutions can play an invaluable role during the model development phase by simplifying training and test data creation for multiclass classification supervised learning use cases. We dive deep into this process on how to use XML tags to structure the prompt and guide Amazon Bedrock in generating a balanced label dataset with high accuracy.

            Generative AI has emerged as a game changer, offering unprecedented opportunities for game designers to push boundaries and create immersive virtual worlds. At the forefront of this revolution is Stability AI’s cutting-edge text-to-image AI model, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5 Large), which is transforming the way we approach game environment creation. In this post, we explore how you can use SD3.5 Large to address practical gaming needs such as early concept art and character design.

            In Microsoft .NET, checking if an IEnumerable contains items can be done using Count(), LongCount(), or Any(). Despite Microsoft’s recommendation to use Any() for efficiency, benchmarks reveal Count() is faster. For optimal performance, it’s advised to benchmark methods contextually. Resources for further learning and performance optimization are provided.
