            We demonstrate two methods for generating structured responses with Amazon Bedrock: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use with the Converse API. Prompt Engineering is flexible, works with Bedrock models (including those without Tool Use support), and handles various schema types (e.g., Open API schemas), making it a great starting point. Tool Use offers greater reliability, consistent results, seamless API integration, and runtime validation of JSON schema for enhanced control.

Here&#39;s what developers, teams, and tech leaders need to know about AI’s uneven, evolving role in software. Rumors of AI’s pervasiveness in software development have been greatly exaggerated.

            Spring Boot is a marvel of developer productivity. It hides the plumbing and gets you up and running fast. Components are “miraculously” autowired, properties are “magically” resolved, and database connections materialize seemingly without explicit configuration. But when something goes wrong, the magic becomes a mystery, and debugging becomes a deep dive into the framework’s internal […]

            User Experience (UX) focuses on the emotional and practical interactions users have with software. It emphasizes designing with the user in mind, which is often overlooked by engineers and managers. Effective UX involves usability, accessibility, performance, and more. Improving UX enhances user satisfaction, loyalty, and overall product success in software development.

After all, the number of computers that supported the Plug and Play specification started at zero, because the specification was still being written. A lot of clever tricks were used to retrofit Plug and Play onto legacy hardware.¹ The Wind

We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds.

You can exclude your application from this feature, and screen capture more generally, by using SetWindowDisplayAffinity and the WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE flag. This is a Windows API function that allows you to set the display affinity of a window, which…
