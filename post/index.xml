            Imagine your application is processing customer checkouts in real-time, while a background process synchronizes data for reporting. Suddenly, the seamless user experience falters because the sync job consumes more RU/s than anticipated. Many teams face a common challenge: multiple workloads share the same container resources, yet each has different performance requirements. We’re excited to introduce […]

            This past March we unveiled our efforts to port the TypeScript compiler and toolset to native code. This port has achieved a 10x speed-up on most projects – not just by using a natively-compiled language (Go), but also through using shared memory parallelism and concurrency where we can benefit. Since then, we have made several […]

As organizations adopt managed database services to support mission-critical applications, they must prioritize robust, scalable, and centralized security. Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) delivers high performance and flexibility, but it provides the most value when paired with well-implemented security practices. Authentication […]

For nearly three decades it has remained the default cockpit for developers building on Microsoft stacks, adapting to every tectonic shift in programming practice: from COM to .NET, from monolithic […] The article Software Innovation: The Epic Journey of Microsoft Visual Studio – Code, Craft, and Continuity was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration pipeline for processing unstructured insurance data using Amazon Bedrock, featuring specialized agents for classification, conversion, and metadata extraction. We demonstrate how this domain-aware approach transforms diverse data formats like claims documents, videos, and audio files into metadata-rich outputs that enable fraud detection, customer 360-degree views, and advanced analytics.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a custom plugin with Amazon Q Business for backend integration. This plugin can integrate existing systems, including third-party systems, with little to no development in just weeks and automate critical workflows. Additionally, we show how to safeguard the solution using Amazon Cognito and AWS IAM Identity Center, maintaining the safety and integrity of sensitive data and workflows.

            Codex is a cloud-based coding agent. Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI o3 optimized for software engineering. codex-1 was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and iteratively runs tests until passing results are achieved.
