            Perhaps one of the largest differences between “Action RunCommand” (internally called RunCommand V1) and “Managed RunCommand” (internally called RunCommand V2) is that Managed RunCommands are ARM resources themselves. That means you can use them in ARM templates. Recently, I needed to issue a RunCommand in an ARM template,

While every resource has an Azure Region (aka location) specified as to where the resource will be hosted, so do Azure Resource Groups. This may be confusing at first, since Azure Resource Groups are a “global” resource. This means they are just an […] The article Why do Azure Resource Groups have an Azure Region association? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            In this two-part series, I’m going to show you how to build and deploy a .NET 8 app container image that targets an ARM64 processor. In part 2, we will attempt to perform an end-to-end process. This will involve building a .NET 8 API, containerizing the app targeting an ARM64 processor using Azure Pipelines, and deploying it on AWS ECS Fargate. Furthermore, a benchmark will also be conducted to compare the performance of the application running on an ARM64 Fargate container versus an AMD64 Fargate container.

            When working with Terraform, one common question that arises is whether to include the .terraform.lock.hcl file in the Git repository or leave it out by adding it to .gitignore. This decision impacts the version control practices and reproducibility of your infrastructure deployments. In this article, we’ll explore the contents of the .terraform.lock.hcl file, discuss why […] The article Should .terraform.lock.hcl file be added to .gitignore or committed to Git repo? appeared first on Build5Nines.

            Redis makes intelligent apps smarter and consistent by serving as additional knowledge store, caching chat history, and semantically cache request and responses for an API. Combined with traditional caching scenarios, Redis is the multi-purpose data store for your intelligent apps.

            This is a guest post co-written with Michael Feil at Gradient. Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) is an important step of the pre-training and fine-tuning process before deployment. The faster and more frequent you’re able to validate performance, the higher the chances you’ll be able to improve the performance of the model. […]
