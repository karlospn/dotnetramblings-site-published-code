            Commenter Shawn wondered why we are so worried about memory access semantics. Back in my day, we just used full barriers everywhere, and I didn&#39;t hear nobody complainin&#39;.

            Microsoft Azure resource naming conventions are one of those “small” DevOps and cloud infrastructure management disciplines that quietly determine whether your cloud estate stays governable at 50 resources—or collapses into entropy at 5,000 resources. In this article, you’ll build a repeatable, region-aware naming strategy using HashiCorp Terraform and the Build5Nines/naming/azure module (which wraps Microsoft’s Azure/naming/azurerm module) to generate compliant […] The article Implementing Azure Naming Conventions at Scale with Terraform and Build5Nines/naming/azure (AzureRM + Region Pairs) was originally published on Build5Nines.

They found that when they subsequently pasted the string (say, into Notepad), the last character didn&#39;t get pasted. As a second experiment, they over-allocated the buffer b

            Created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and first released in 1995, Ruby arrived with a purpose that was simple but profound: to make coding more human, more intuitive, and more enjoyable. Its object-oriented model, dynamic typing, and elegant syntax offered a fresh alternative to the heavier and more complex languages of that era. As Ruby marks […]

            In this post, we explore how to programmatically create an IDP solution that uses Strands SDK, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, and Bedrock Data Automation (BDA). This solution is provided through a Jupyter notebook that enables users to upload multi-modal business documents and extract insights using BDA as a parser to retrieve relevant chunks and augment a prompt to a foundational model (FM).

            Enterprise organizations increasingly rely on web-based applications for critical business processes, yet many workflows remain manually intensive, creating operational inefficiencies and compliance risks. Despite significant technology investments, knowledge workers routinely navigate between eight to twelve different web applications during standard workflows, constantly switching contexts and manually transferring information between systems. Data entry and validation tasks […]

            If you’ve been keeping up with Java virtual threads, you already know that this hot new feature significantly improves hardware utilization for parallel I/O-bound operations. Virtual threads map multiple concurrent I/O operations to a single OS thread without blocking. The novel aspect of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to the codebase, as […]

            This post explores Chain-of-Draft (CoD), an innovative prompting technique introduced in a Zoom AI Research paper Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less, that revolutionizes how models approach reasoning tasks. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been the go-to method for enhancing model reasoning, CoD offers a more efficient alternative that mirrors human problem-solving patterns—using concise, high-signal thinking steps rather than verbose explanations.

            To address the need for businesses to quickly analyze information and unlock actionable insights, we are announcing Analytics Agent, a new feature that is seamlessly integrated into the GenAI IDP Accelerator. With this feature, users can perform advanced searches and complex analyses using natural language queries without SQL or data analysis expertise. In this post, we discuss how non-technical users can use this tool to analyze and understand the documents they have processed at scale with natural language.

            What is Mark of the Web? Mark of the Web (MOTW) is a Windows security feature that protects users from potentially unsafe files downloaded from the internet. When you download a file, Windows automatically adds a special metadata tag indicating the file originated from an untrusted source and may contain harmful content. Windows components such as Microsoft Edge and Windows Explorer use MOTW to determine…

            Microsoft advises initializing reference type static fields inline to enhance code readability and prevent issues from uninitialized fields. Two patterns are shown: inline initialization and using a static constructor. While both methods do not allocate memory, using a static constructor may slightly improve performance. EditorConfig can check for adherence to this guideline.

Developer Productivity Became the Real Competitive Advantage By mid-year, every major AI lab had cleared the “good enough reasoning” bar.

            Security vulnerabilities don&#39;t fix themselves. Someone needs to track them, prioritize them, and actually ship the fix. If you&#39;ve ever tried to manage security alerts alongside your regular sprint work, though, you know the friction: you&#39;re looking at an alert in one tab, switching to your backlog in another, trying to remember which vulner

            This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev. Docker has changed the way we build and ship software. Instead of wrestling with “it works on my machine” issues, developers can now package applications and all their dependencies into a neat, portable container that runs anywhere. No wonder Docker has become the de facto […]
