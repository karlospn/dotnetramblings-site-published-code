            Migrate to a Vertical Slice Architecture from a monolith? Is it more like microservices? Does it replace Clean Architecture? None of the above. It’s about being driven by cohesion of business capabilities and business processes. It has nothing to do with layers or physical deployment concerns.

            Signing commits in Git is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of your commits. This ensures that the commits are indeed made by you and have not been tampered with. On Windows, it&#39;s easy to set up SSH-Agent for easy signature. Here&#39;s how you can do it. First, you need to install SSH on Windows. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator and run the following command to install the OpenSSH…

            If you&#39;re like me, 2024 was the year in which using LLM for code generation went from a curiosity that I occasionally tried out when all other avenues failed, to something that has become an essential part of day-to-day development work. Availability and pricing When the year began the availability of these tools was mostly limited to paying customers, but with the majority of LLMs now offering completely free tiers that are perfectly capable of generating code, and now tools like GitHub Copilot (also now offering a free tier) that integrate directly with your IDE, it seems inevitable that in 2025 it will become an integral part of the way most developers write code.
