            AI agents are evolving beyond basic single-task helpers into more powerful systems that can plan, critique, and collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems. Deep Agents—a recently introduced framework built on LangGraph—bring these capabilities to life, enabling multi-agent workflows that mirror real-world team dynamics. The challenge, however, is not just building such agents but […]

However, traditional automated techniques, and their respective tools, are not usually user-friendly, having a command-line interface and not being integrated with the IDE. To boost acceleration and quality […]

Rather than relying on long‑lived API keys, your workflow can use a short‑lived GitHub OIDC token to request a temporary, single‑use NuGet API key. These keys expire quickly (≈ 1 hour), eliminating long‑

            ObservableList enhances the typical List by integrating event notifications for dynamic collection changes, making it ideal for MVVM applications in WPF, MAUI, and Xamarin. It supports multiple constructors, provides essential methods for collection management, and raises relevant events to keep UI synchronized, ensuring responsive and maintainable applications.

Stop the blame game Timebox efforts and invite curiosity on reviews Check out the livestream (or watch the recording) on Monday, September 22nd, at 7:00 PM Pacific!
Empowering Junior Developers on Reviews If you have juniors on your team, you may have run into this:
Pull requests piling up Reviews slowing down ... and everyone quietly frustrated
Is it just because your code is too complex? Maybe not. Should we point the finger at the junior developers and blame them?

            GraphQL APIs enables clients to request specific data sets, reducing over-fetching compared to traditional REST APIs, which return fixed data structures with unnecessary fields. Unlike REST APIs that require multiple endpoints and round trips to gather related data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint. This enables clients to fetch exactly what they need in one request, improving […]
