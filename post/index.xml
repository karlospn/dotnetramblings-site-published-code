            In the world of .NET, memory management is an important aspect of any application. Fortunately, you don&#39;t have to shoulder this immense task yourself. .NET handles it with the superpower of the Garbage Collector (GC). A GC is an engine that keeps your app fast, responsive, and resource-efficient.

            Development and testing of AWS integrated applications incur AWS costs and need reliable internet connectivity. LocalStack helps reduce AWS costs by running emulated AWS services locally, while also eliminating connectivity issues. In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to reduce AWS costs for a sample .NET application in Development and Test cycles by setting […]

            In this post, we demonstrate how to integrate Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with Anyscale platform to address critical infrastructure challenges in building and deploying large-scale AI models. The combined solution provides robust infrastructure for distributed AI workloads with high-performance hardware, continuous monitoring, and seamless integration with Ray, the leading AI compute engine, enabling organizations to reduce time-to-market and lower total cost of ownership.

            In this post, we introduce Amazon Nova customization for text content moderation through Amazon SageMaker AI, enabling organizations to fine-tune models for their specific moderation needs. The evaluation across three benchmarks shows that customized Nova models achieve an average improvement of 7.3% in F1 scores compared to the baseline Nova Lite, with individual improvements ranging from 4.2% to 9.2% across different content moderation tasks.

            One of the major, recurring complaints of the OData.NET libraries is the performance overhead of the serialization stack. We have done a lot of work to improve the serialization performance, but the existing architecture limits how far we can go. For this reason, we have started work on a new serialization stack for OData.NET libraries that ad

            This discusses the principles of defensive programming to enhance software development. It emphasizes error prevention strategies such as input validation, comprehensive error handling, and assumption checking. By adopting these practices, developers can create reliable, maintainable applications, reduce bugs and their associated costs, and improve overall code quality and user satisfaction.

            In this post, we demonstrated how a financial services company can use an FM to process large volumes of customer records and get specific data-driven product recommendations. We also showed how to implement an automated monitoring solution for Amazon Bedrock batch inference jobs. By using EventBridge, Lambda, and DynamoDB, you can gain real-time visibility into batch processing operations, so you can efficiently generate personalized product recommendations based on customer credit data.
