            Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance costs typically range from $450,000 to over $2 million and take 12 to 18 months to achieve, time your competitors are using to capture government contracts. While you’re spending months configuring FIPS cryptography, hardening security baselines, and navigating 400+ security controls, your competitors are already shipping to...

            A customer was developing a service, and they didn&#39;t want users to be able to change the service&#39;s startup type (e.g. change it from auto-start to disabled). They saw that other services had the &amp;quot;Startup type&amp;quot; field disabled. How can they get in on that action? They found that that they could get close to the desired behavior by restricting

            You’ve seen it before. Someone says, “It works on my machine,” and suddenly you’re deep in a rabbit hole trying to understand why a project that works perfectly on one machine fails to build or test on another. That’s configuration drift – when a developer’s actual environment starts to deviate from the project’s intended configuration. […]

In practice, there remains a fundamental – and often painful – tension between the promised security perfection of hardened images and...

            Windows issues monthly updates, but the bigger updates happen twice a year. The one that happens in the first half of the year is called the H1 release, and the one in the second half is the H2 release. The letter H refers to &amp;quot;half&amp;quot;, which is the same pattern used by finance people to refer to the first and second halves of fiscal years. (Q

The solution includes an ETL pipeline using AWS Glue and Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize usage patterns, token consumption, and cost allocation across different tenants and departments.

            In this post, we highlight how you can deploy multiple generative AI models in Amazon Bedrock to instruct an LLM model to create thematic summaries of text responses. We then show how to use multiple LLM models as a jury to review these LLM-generated summaries and assign a rating to judge the content alignment between the summary title and summary description.

            In this post, we introduce the newly announced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. We explore why organizations need cloud-based browser automation and the limitations it addresses for FMs that require real-time data access. We talk about key use cases and the core capabilities of the AgentCore Browser Tool. We walk through how to get started with the tool.

            Today we are excited to announce the release of TypeScript 5.9! If you&#39;re not familiar with TypeScript, it&#39;s a language that builds on JavaScript by adding syntax for types. With types, TypeScript makes it possible to check your code to avoid bugs ahead of time. The TypeScript type-checker does all this, and is also the foundation of grea

            In this post, we discuss how to implement a low-code no-code AIOps solution that helps organizations monitor, identify, and troubleshoot operational events while maintaining their security posture. We show how these technologies work together to automate repetitive tasks, streamline incident response, and enhance operational efficiency across your organization.

            A customer was writing a program that was intended to run in the background and was looking for recommendations on how to store its PID so that other programs can find it and start communicating with the background process. Another customer was writing a provider program that will have multiple clients connect to it. They want the p

            Rust and Java couldn’t be any more different. One is a battle-tested giant with enterprise-scale use cases. The other is a relative newbie with a rapidly growing community and real-world applications. While Rust is praised for its focus on safety and performance, its complexity presents a challenge to adopters (arguably, the steep learning curve is […]
