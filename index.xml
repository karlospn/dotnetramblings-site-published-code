            On CI, some projects use the msbuild diagnostic verbosity to get more information about the build. This is useful to troubleshoot build issues. However, this verbosity level has some drawbacks. In this post, I describe how to use the binary log feature of MSBuild to get the same information in a more efficient way. Diagnostic verbosity vs binary log The msbuild diagnostic verbosity is the most verbose…

            Ever made a change to your Blazor app’s CSS only to find, when you publish your app, it seems to be stuck using the old styles? Modern browsers love to cache static assets like stylesheets. It speeds up performance and saves re-fetching the same thing multiple times from the server. The problem comes when you make changes to the stylesheet and push out a new version. Unless you change the filename of the stylesheet, the browser sees that your site is requesting a file it’s already cached and diligently serves the contents from the cache.

            The post introduces a series called &amp;quot;dotNetDave&#39;s Faster or Not!&amp;quot; which aims to explore performance claims in .NET. It discusses method return patterns, comparing early returns and single-exit methods. Despite minor performance differences favoring early returns, the author advocates for their use due to improved readability and reduced complexity in coding.

            AWS provides a powerful set of tools and services that simplify the process of building and deploying generative AI applications, even for those with limited experience in frontend and backend development. In this post, we explore a practical solution that uses Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive data applications, and AWS services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Cognito, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create a user-friendly generative AI application with authentication and deployment.

             Introduction: Simplifying Caching with Aspect-Oriented Programming in .NET Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers elegant solutions for handling cross-cutting concerns in our .NET applications, such as method caching. In a previous article on GoatReview 🐐, we explored using Fody to implement a caching aspect. Although powerful, this tool presents significant challenges.
