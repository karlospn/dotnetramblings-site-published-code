            In this post, we demonstrate how you can use the A2A protocol for AI agents built with different frameworks to collaborate seamlessly. You&#39;ll learn how to deploy A2A servers on AgentCore Runtime, configure agent discovery and authentication, and build a real-world multi-agent system for incident response. We&#39;ll cover the complete A2A request lifecycle, from agent card discovery to task delegation, showing how standardized protocols eliminate the complexity of multi-agent coordination.

            The Cohere Embed 4 multimodal embeddings model is now available as a fully managed, serverless option in Amazon Bedrock. In this post, we dive into the benefits and unique capabilities of Embed 4 for enterprise search use cases. We’ll show you how to quickly get started using Embed 4 on Amazon Bedrock, taking advantage of integrations with Strands Agents, S3 Vectors, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build powerful agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

            The regulatory landscape for GxP compliance is evolving to address the unique characteristics of AI. Traditional Computer System Validation (CSV) approaches, often with uniform validation strategies, are being supplemented by Computer Software Assurance (CSA) frameworks that emphasize flexible risk-based validation methods tailored to each system&#39;s actual impact and complexity (FDA latest guidance). In this post, we cover a risk-based implementation, practical implementation considerations across different risk levels, the AWS shared responsibility model for compliance, and concrete examples of risk mitigation strategies.

            We’ve all had bloated CQRS handlers. You open up a command, query, or event handler, and it’s a bloated mess. It’s a nightmare of code. There’s validation, authorization, state changes, side effects, logging, it’s a mess to maintain and it’s really hard to test.

            This post is for Linux users running Docker Engine (Community Edition) directly on their hosts. Docker Desktop users don’t need to take any action — Engine updates are included automatically in future Desktop releases. Docker Engine v29 is a foundational release that sets the stage for the future of the Docker platform. While it may...

            Whenever possible, Windows 95 made application compatibility tweaks through things like compatibility flags that alter the behavior of the system for any program the flag was applied to. Using compatibility flags allows the fix to be generalized: If one program has a problem, there&#39;s a good chance that another program will also have that sa

            In just a year, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to tools and external systems. The Docker MCP Catalog now hosts hundreds of containerized local MCP servers, enabling developers to quickly experiment and prototype locally. We have now added support for remote MCP servers to the Docker MCP...

            Building agents is weird. You’re not writing code that does things. You’re writing code that gives an LLM the ability to do things, and the LLM decides what to do. What is an agent? An agent is an LLM that calls your functions in a loop until it decides the task is complete. That shift […]

            If you have ever had to generate Excel reports in C#-based applications, you know the pain of choosing from too many libraries with too many tradeoffs. Some are extremely powerful but painful to write, while others are friendly but struggle with large files. You probably come across OpenXML, EPPlus,

            In this post, we demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs provides a powerful and flexible approach to automate and significantly enhance document understanding capabilities. We also demonstrate that using focused fine-tuning allows smaller, multi-modal models to compete effectively with much larger counterparts (98% accuracy with Qwen2.5 VL 3B).

            C# has long supported extension methods, allowing developers to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. However, this capability was limited to instance methods. With C# 14, the language introduces extension members, significantly expanding what you can extend. You can now add extension properties and extension static methods to existing types. This enhancement is…

            Enums enhance code readability but can lead to errors if not validated, as any integer can be cast as an Enum, including invalid values. Validating Enum inputs prevents silent data corruption, ensures meaningful defaults, and avoids processing impossible states. Always validate at method boundaries and define a zero value as &amp;quot;unknown.&amp;quot;

            Distributed systems don&#39;t fail cleanly: they retry, duplicate, and occasionally fail. This article shows how to design resilient message handlers in .NET using broker-level idempotency and the Idempotent Consumer pattern, so your system stays consistent no matter how many times a message is delivered.

            The USB MIDI 1.0 specification was released in the late 90s around the same time that PCs were starting to move from rectangular beige boxes to things like fake-silvered bulbous plastic shapes. At this point, some of the code in Windows to support USB MIDI 1.0 has become intergenerational – it&#39;s certainly older than my teenagers here at h

            In this blog post, we explore how TR addressed key business use cases with Open Arena, a highly scalable and flexible no-code AI solution powered by Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services such as Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda. We&#39;ll explain how TR used AWS services to build this solution, including how the architecture was designed, the use cases it solves, and the business profiles that use it.

      <title>Introducing structured output for Custom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock</title>

            Today, we are excited to announce the addition of structured output to Custom Model Import. Structured output constrains a model&#39;s generation process in real time so that every token it produces conforms to a schema you define. Rather than relying on prompt-engineering tricks or brittle post-processing scripts, you can now generate structured outputs directly at inference time.

      <title>Most DevSecOps Advice Is Useless without Context—Here’s What Actually Works</title>

            Generic DevSecOps advice may sound good on paper, but it often fails in practice because it ignores team context, workflow, and environment-specific needs. Overloaded controls, broad policies, and misapplied tools disrupt the flow of development. And once flow breaks, security measures are the first to get bypassed. The way forward isn&#39;t more rules but smarter...

            Introduction LLMs are enabling a new generation of multi-agent systems that tackle complex, multi-step tasks. Moving from prototype to production is hard—especially when orchestrating dozens or hundreds of specialized agents. Commercial viability depends on intentional design, scalability, latency control, and predictable outcomes.
