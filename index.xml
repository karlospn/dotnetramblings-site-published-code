            This article examines the significance of extension methods in .NET, emphasizing their role in enhancing existing types without altering source code. It also introduces Extension Members in .NET 10 (C# 14), allowing the addition of both methods and properties, thus expanding developers&#39; capabilities. While there are limitations, they improve code maintainability and flexibility.

            There’s no denying the massive wave of excitement around Agentic AI, Multi-Agent Systems, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether it’s people experimenting with Copilots, implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns, spinning up AI agents, or integrating LLMs into enterprise apps, there’s a real energy behind this shift. But as exciting (and disruptive) as this […] The article It’s Still About the Data: Practical Approach to Building with Agentic AI, LLMs and Generative AI was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Building UI in .NET MAUI with XAML continues to be the most popular approach. It&#39;s easy to see the nesting structure of your UI, works for most use cases with hot reload, and it supports powerful state flow with data binding. One of the downsides is how verbose it can become. Every page requires you to declare the namespaces for any types used

            We demonstrate two methods for generating structured responses with Amazon Bedrock: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use with the Converse API. Prompt Engineering is flexible, works with Bedrock models (including those without Tool Use support), and handles various schema types (e.g., Open API schemas), making it a great starting point. Tool Use offers greater reliability, consistent results, seamless API integration, and runtime validation of JSON schema for enhanced control.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock Agents to solve complex business questions in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show how specialized agents in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), legal, and finance domains can work together to provide comprehensive business insights by analyzing data from multiple sources.

            AI is changing software development — but not how you think The hype is real, but so are the challenges. Here&#39;s what developers, teams, and tech leaders need to know about AI’s uneven, evolving role in software. Rumors of AI’s pervasiveness in software development have been greatly exaggerated. A look under the hood shows adoption...

            Spring Boot is a marvel of developer productivity. It hides the plumbing and gets you up and running fast. Components are “miraculously” autowired, properties are “magically” resolved, and database connections materialize seemingly without explicit configuration. But when something goes wrong, the magic becomes a mystery, and debugging becomes a deep dive into the framework’s internal […]

            User Experience (UX) focuses on the emotional and practical interactions users have with software. It emphasizes designing with the user in mind, which is often overlooked by engineers and managers. Effective UX involves usability, accessibility, performance, and more. Improving UX enhances user satisfaction, loyalty, and overall product success in software development.

            In this post, we demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds.

            A long time ago, I stood in a packed room at VS Live! and watched developers erupt in applause after a debugging demo shaved hours off a real-world problem. That was the moment I realized this wasn’t just a conference—it was a place where developers and toolmakers come together to push the craft forward. I’m excited to announce that I

This problem plagued C++ until C++11 added a special rule:¹ [temp.names] (4): When parsing a template-argument-list, the first non-nested &amp;gt; is taken as the ending delimiter rath

            Some applications are displaying sensitive information. With Recall, Windows can take a screenshot of your screen regularly and store sensitive information. You can exclude your application from this feature, and screen capture more generally, by using SetWindowDisplayAffinity and the WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE flag. This is a Windows API function that allows you to set the display affinity of a window, which…
