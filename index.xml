            You may have encountered a situation where you must do some backend job without user intervention. For example, in an IOT application, your application needs to receive frequently published data from devices or send scheduler values to devices. .NET provides background job libraries for such tasks. I will discuss one

            In this post, we show you how DXC and AWS collaborated to build an AI assistant using large language models (LLMs), enabling users to access and analyze different data types from a variety of data sources. The AI assistant is powered by an intelligent agent that routes user questions to specialized tools that are optimized for different data types such as text, tables, and domain-specific formats. It uses the LLM’s ability to understand natural language, write code, and reason about conversational context.

            MSD, a leading pharmaceutical company, collaborates with AWS to implement a powerful text-to-SQL generative AI solution using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic&#39;s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. This approach streamlines data extraction from complex healthcare databases like DE-SynPUF, enabling analysts to generate SQL queries from natural language questions. The solution addresses challenges such as coded columns, non-intuitive names, and ambiguous queries, significantly reducing query time and democratizing data access.

            In this post, we explain how InsuranceDekho harnessed the power of generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude to provide responses to customer queries on policy coverages, exclusions, and more. This let our customer care agents and POSPs confidently help our customers understand the policies without reaching out to insurance subject matter experts (SMEs) or memorizing complex plans while providing sales and after-sales services. The use of this solution has improved sales, cross-selling, and overall customer service experience.

            In a recent post, I shared how to highlight C# code in string values. Roslyn provides more built-in highlighters / code-completions in string values. Most of the supported languages are available as constants of the StringSyntaxAttribute class. To indicate the language, you can use the lang or language comment or the [StringSyntax] attribute. The languages mentioned in this post are handled by Roslyn (VS,…

            In C#, method binding refers to associating a method call with the method’s code definition. When we invoke a method, the program determines which specific method to execute. This process, known as “binding,” can occur at two different times: during compile-time (early binding) or runtime (late binding). By using early binding, we can use compile-time […] The post Early Binding and Late Binding in C# appeared first on Code Maze.

The Meta Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct models demonstrated impressive performance on the challenging DocVQA benchmark for visual question answering. By using the power of Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, we demonstrate the process of adapting these generative AI models to excel at understanding and responding to natural language questions about images.

            Cloud costs can significantly impact your business operations. Gaining real-time visibility into infrastructure expenses, usage patterns, and cost drivers is essential. To allocate costs to cloud resources, a tagging strategy is essential. This post outlines steps you can take to implement a comprehensive tagging governance strategy across accounts, using AWS tools and services that provide visibility and control. By setting up automated policy enforcement and checks, you can achieve cost optimization across your machine learning (ML) environment.

            So you’ve set out to build your shiny new web app using Blazor. Blazor’s component model is more than up to the task and you spend a few weeks happily building out UI to meet your requirements. But then you run into a requirement to integrate with a JavaScript library. Curse it! Now you have to figure out how to make calls to a JavaScript library from your Blazor app. This is exactly the kind of requirement that can get complicated, pretty quickly.

            In this blog post, we demonstrate prompt engineering techniques to generate accurate and relevant analysis of tabular data using industry-specific language. This is done by providing large language models (LLMs) in-context sample data with features and labels in the prompt. The results are similar to fine-tuning LLMs without the complexities of fine-tuning models.
