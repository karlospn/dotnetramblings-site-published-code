            A customer asked if there was a helper function in the system that accepted two strings and reported whether the GUIDs they represent are equal. This is a tricky question, because you first have to decide what “represent” means. There are many ways of representing a GUID as a string. It could be just 32 […]

            Microsoft has announced the retirement of the azureedge.net domain by January 15, 2025, driven by Edgio’s (formerly Limelight Networks) business closure. This domain underpins Azure CDN services, .NET installations, and content delivery for various Azure and Microsoft services. The shift requires developers and DevOps teams to update configurations, pipelines, and deployment practices to ensure continuity. […] The article Retirement of AzureEdge.net DNS: Edg.io Business Closure and What You Need to Know was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this blog post, we showcase how you can perform efficient supervised fine tuning for a Meta Llama 3 model using PEFT on AWS Trainium with SageMaker HyperPod. We use HuggingFace’s Optimum-Neuron software development kit (SDK) to apply LoRA to fine-tuning jobs, and use SageMaker HyperPod as the primary compute cluster to perform distributed training on Trainium. Using LoRA supervised fine-tuning for Meta Llama 3 models, you can further reduce your cost to fine tune models by up to 50% and reduce the training time by 70%.

            Anthropic recently unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants and models to reliable data and tools. However, packaging and distributing MCP servers is very challenging due to complex environment setups across multiple architectures and operating systems. Docker is the perfect solution for this – it allows developers to encapsulate […]

            With Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), bigger has often better. LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini Pro have dominated headlines for their massive scale and capabilities. However, Microsoft is redefining this narrative with Phi-4, a 14-billion parameter small language model (SLM) that delivers exceptional performance, rivaling models many times its size. Phi-4 […] The article Phi-4: Microsoft’s New Small Language Model Outperforms Giants in AI Reasoning was originally published on Build5Nines.

            When building voice-enabled chatbots with Amazon Lex, one of the biggest challenges is accurately capturing user speech input for slot values. Transcription confidence scores can help ensure reliable slot filling. This blog post outlines strategies like progressive confirmation, adaptive re-prompting, and branching logic to create more robust slot filling experiences.

In this post, we explore why GraphRAG is more comprehensive and explainable than vector RAG alone, and how you can use this approach using AWS services and Lettria.

            Ten years ago I wrote an article entitled Five Audio Processing Tasks that are a Lot Harder than you Think. It was borne out of my frustration that many users of my NAudio library had unrealistic expectations about what was achievable.
