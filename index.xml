Microsoft also implements these techniques widely in […]

            Migrating an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) from one Azure Region to another can be necessary for several reasons, including disaster recovery, optimizing performance, or reducing latency. While Azure provides various options for replication and failover, one of the most efficient ways to migrate a VM manually involves creating a Snapshot of the VM Disks, copying […] The article Migrate Azure VM Across Regions Using Azure CLI and Bash Script was originally published on Build5Nines.

            When you need to access a shared resource, you can use the lock statement or a synchronization primitive such as a Mutex to synchronize access to the resource. However, it&#39;s easy to forget it in complex code. When you need to synchronize access to a single resource, you can use a var obj = new object(); var value = 42; lock (obj) { // You need to ensure you use lock everywhere you access the shared…

            Static code analysis refers to the practice of scanning code for potential problems without actually running the code. Inspections in IntelliJ IDEA can detect potential problems in your project before you compile it. The IDE can highlight various problems, locate dead code, find probable bugs and spelling problems, and improve the overall code structure. This […]
