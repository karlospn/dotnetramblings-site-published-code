            Today, we’re excited to announce the general availability of these evaluation features in Amazon Bedrock Evaluations, along with significant enhancements that make them fully environment-agnostic. In this post, we explore these new features in detail, showing you how to evaluate both RAG systems and models with practical examples. We demonstrate how to use the comparison capabilities to benchmark different implementations and make data-driven decisions about your AI deployments.

            In this post, we introduce a state-of-the-art method to fine-tune LLMs by reinforcement learning, reviewed the pros and cons of RLHF vs. RLAIF vs. DPO, and saw how to scale LLM fine-tuning efforts with RLAIF. We also see how to implement an end-to-end RLAIF pipeline on SageMaker using the Hugging Face Transformer and TRL libraries, and using either off-the-shelf toxicity reward models to align responses during PPO or by directly prompting an LLM to generate quantitative reward feedback during PPO.

            Identifying edge cases for testing can be a challenging task, often leaving hidden bugs and vulnerabilities undetected. Fuzz testing (fuzzing) addresses this challenge by automatically generating tests with random or invalid inputs, enabling developers to uncover unexpected exceptions and failure scenarios. Thanks to its effectiveness in detecting critical software flaws, fuzzing has gained widespread use […]

            In optimizing the Spargine project, I improved performance by avoiding constant arrays as method arguments. Instead, using static readonly fields reduced memory allocations significantly. This change enhanced execution speed, yielding a 1.34x performance gain. I recommend enabling CA1856 warnings in .editorconfig to maintain performance-focused coding practices.

            Inspecting wind turbines, power lines, 5G towers, and pipelines is a tough job. It’s often dangerous, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This post is the first in a three-part series exploring AI Workforce, the AWS AI-powered drone inspection system. In this post, we introduce the concept and key benefits. The second post dives into the AWS architecture that powers AI Workforce, and the third focuses on the drone setup and integration.

This can be incredibly useful for logging, debugging, or tracing. The attributes CallerMemberName, CallerFilePath, and CallerLineNumber provide information such as the name of the calling method, the path to the source file […]

It also notes companies that do not use .NET, promoting awareness of diverse technology stacks. Community support for these organizations is encouraged to sustain .NET&#39;s relevance.

            We’re excited to announce the open source release of AWS MCP Servers for code assistants — a suite of specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that bring Amazon Web Services (AWS) best practices directly to your development workflow. This post is the first in a series covering AWS MCP Servers. In this post, we walk through how these specialized MCP servers can dramatically reduce your development time while incorporating security controls, cost optimizations, and AWS Well-Architected best practices into your code.

            I&#39;m pleased to announce my latest Pluralsight course, Refactor and Optimize Code with GitHub Copilot, has just gone live. It will be part of a series of courses covering various aspects of using GitHub Copilot, and my course focuses specifically on using Copilot to refactor, modernize and optimize code. This is an important topic as many of us are spending a lot of time working on existing legacy codebases, and learning to use GenAI effectively with these projects is a great investment of your time.

            The [ConstantExpected] attribute in .NET enhances code analysis by indicating that methods or parameters require compile-time constants. It helps improve performance, catch inefficiencies, and reduce CA1856 warnings. A practical example in the Spargine project shows its impact. Integrating this attribute can yield significant performance benefits for developers.
