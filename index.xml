            Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding emotions in text. While there are many ways to approach sentiment analysis, including more traditional lexicon-based and machine learning approaches, today we’ll be focusing on one of the most cutting-edge ways of working with text – large language models (LLMs). We’ll explain how you can use these […]

            Today at AWS re:Invent 2024, we are excited to announce the new Container Caching capability in Amazon SageMaker, which significantly reduces the time required to scale generative AI models for inference. This innovation allows you to scale your models faster, observing up to 56% reduction in latency when scaling a new model copy and up to 30% when adding a model copy on a new instance. In this post, we explore the new Container Caching feature for SageMaker inference, addressing the challenges of deploying and scaling large language models (LLMs).

            Earlier this year, the Office Platform Team announced that Exchange Online legacy tokens are deprecated and will be turned off. This is part of Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative (SFI) to give organizations the tools they need in the current threat landscape. We’ll begin turning off legacy tokens in February 2025. Publishers and developers are actively migrating their Outlook add-ins to use Entra ID tokens through nested app authentication (NAA) and Microsoft Graph instead of legacy tokens.

            Semantic Kernel (SK) 是由微软开发的一款开源开发工具包，旨在帮助开发者和企业利用最新的人工智能技术构建更智能和复杂的AI驱动解决方案，例如检索增强生成 (RAG) 和智能体 (Agent)。 核心概念 内核（Kernel） 您可以将SK的内核视为一个容器，该容器包含您所需的所有与AI相关的组件，如提示语模板、AI服务和插件。如果将所有的服务和插件提供给内核，则AI会根据需求自动使用它们。SK还提供多项企业级功能，使您可以保证您的AI符合安全要求且在部署后能够持续监控AI的表现。 提示语（Prompt Engineering） 提示语在使用大型语言模型中至关重要。优质的提示语能够显著提升用户体验。SK通过提示语模板（template）的方式来实现自然语言与AI插件的混合使用，让您的提示语变得更加的灵活。 AI服务（AI Services） SK支持多种AI应用场景，包括对话补全，文本生成，嵌入（embedding）生成，图像与文字转换，以及音频与文字转换。此外，SK兼容多个AI服务提供商，如OpenAI，Azure，Google AI， Amazon Bedrock， 以及提供本地推理服务的Ollama等。 插件（Plugins/Functions） SK通过插件支持扩展大型语言模型的功能。插件可以是代码或自然语言，并可集成外部系统，如数据库、API或其他云服务，以便AI解决方案获取动态信息。 矢量存储（Vector Stores） 矢量存储可以被视为存储嵌入的数据库。许多现代数据库已开始提供矢量存储服务，这在构建RAG方案的检索步骤中扮演着重要角色。SK支持市场上大部分的矢量数据库，比如说Azure AI Search，Azure Cosmos DB，Qdrant，Redis， 和Weaviate等。 企业组件（Enterprise Components） SK自项目启动之初便将企业级AI解决方案作为首要目标。SK提供一系列功能以增强AI的安全性，包括筛选器（Filter）和可观察性（Observability）。筛选器可用于过滤提示语，确保不处理不安全的提示，并在生成式AI的回答到达终端用户前进行适当过滤。可观察性确保您在将AI部署到分布式系统时，仍能了解系统内部的运行状态，包括token的使用情况、函数的运行时间、以及大型语言模型的输入输出等。 框架 除了上述核心功能外，SK还提供一下框架，以帮助您构建更复杂的AI解决方案： 智能体框架：利用了SK生态创建和管理AI智能体。 业务流框架：利用了SK生态使企业能更有效地创建，管理和部署完整的AI业务流程。 关于这两个框架的详细介绍，我将在后续文章中单独阐述，敬请期待！ 开始使用 目前，SK支持三种编程语言：C#，Python，和Java。SK的源代码托管在GitHub上。您可以访问我们的仓库以获取源代码，文档和开发示例： C#源代码：semantic-kernel/dotnet at main · microsoft/semantic-kernel C#示例：semantic-kernel/dotnet/samples at main · microsoft/semantic-kernel Python源代码：semantic-kernel/python at main · microsoft/semantic-kernel […]

            Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly generative models like GPT-4, have transformed numerous industries. However, these models sometimes struggle with accuracy, especially when generating outputs based on limited or outdated training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an innovative approach designed to address these challenges, combining the generative strengths of AI with the precision of retrieval systems. […] The article Enhance AI System Accuracy using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Long-running business processes often require multiple services working together, but traditional distributed transactions can be problematic at scale. Learn how to implement the Saga pattern using MassTransit to break complex workflows into manageable steps with proper error handling and state management.

            The new efficient multi-adapter inference feature of Amazon SageMaker unlocks exciting possibilities for customers using fine-tuned models. This capability integrates with SageMaker inference components to allow you to deploy and manage hundreds of fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters through SageMaker APIs. In this post, we show how to use the new efficient multi-adapter inference feature in SageMaker.

            Last year Gradle announced a new experimental project called Declarative Gradle that aims to make Gradle build scripts easier to read and use. Instead of writing detailed instructions for how to build your project, Declarative Gradle allows you to describe what your software needs (like libraries, applications, or tests) in a clear and simple way.

            I’m not a competitive programmer – far from it. I never received formal education in advanced algorithms and data structures. In fact, I can’t even implement Dijkstra’s algorithm without referring to Wikipedia. Yet, I still participate in Advent of Code competitions. I’ve never made it onto an official leaderboard; I’m too slow for that. Completing […]
