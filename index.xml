            In this post, we present an LLM migration paradigm and architecture, including a continuous process of model evaluation, prompt generation using Amazon Bedrock, and data-aware optimization. The solution evaluates the model performance before migration and iteratively optimizes the Amazon Nova model prompts using user-provided dataset and objective metrics.

            As C# developers, we sometimes must interact dynamically with objects, fields, properties, methods, or types. Use cases such as inter-mapping between types, traversing model properties, developing an extensible system, injecting dependencies, etc., demand runtime handling. You may wonder how to tackle such scenarios. In this post, I will show you

            In this post, we demonstrate model customization (fine-tuning) for tool use with Amazon Nova. We first introduce a tool usage use case, and gave details about the dataset. We walk through the details of Amazon Nova specific data formatting and showed how to do tool calling through the Converse and Invoke APIs in Amazon Bedrock. After getting the baseline results from Amazon Nova models, we explain in detail the fine-tuning process, hosting fine-tuned models with provisioned throughput, and using the fine-tuned Amazon Nova models for inference.

We demonstrated how this evaluation framework can be integrated with pharmaceutical research agents. We used it to evaluate agent performance against biomarker questions and sent traces to Langfuse to view evaluation metrics across question types.

            When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), generating structured outputs like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is invaluable for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and integration with spreadsheet applications. However, since LLMs are primarily optimized for natural language generation, crafting prompts that yield valid CSV-formatted data requires careful engineering. This article provides strategies and examples to […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid CSV Data was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Why not self-host using a VPS or dedicated hardware instead of using the cloud? Well, there are a lot of reasons. The cloud isn’t just about scaling; it’s about managed services.

            In this post, we explore two approaches for securing sensitive data in RAG applications using Amazon Bedrock. The first approach focused on identifying and redacting sensitive data before ingestion into an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and the second demonstrated a fine-grained RBAC pattern for managing access to sensitive information during retrieval. These solutions represent just two possible approaches among many for securing sensitive data in generative AI applications.
