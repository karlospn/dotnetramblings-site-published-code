            The article critiques code analysis rule CA1828 in Microsoft .NET, which suggests using AnyAsync() over CountAsync() for checking item existence in IQueryable collections. Benchmark results indicate CountAsync() outperforms both AnyAsync() and LongCountAsync(), pointing to potential inefficiencies in following CA1828. The author recommends adjusting rule severity to optimize performance.

            Today I’m excited to announce the next steps we’re taking to radically improve TypeScript performance. The core value proposition of TypeScript is an excellent developer experience. As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases. Developers […]

Built on the IntelliJ Platform, Writerside was available in two versions: a standalone tool and a plugin for JetBrains IDEs. Our goal was to serve two key audiences – developers who document their work and […]

            Dependency injection (DI) is a powerful feature in .NET applications. It allows you the decoupling of dependencies by injecting required services at runtime, ensuring the modularity and testability of your code. You can create separate services or import them from NuGet packages by registering them into your application. However, injecting

            In the dynamic field of conversational AI, managing coherent and contextually meaningful interactions between humans and digital assistants poses increasingly complex challenges. As dialogue lengths extend, maintaining full conversational context becomes problematic due to token constraints and memory limitations inherent to large language models (LLMs). These constraints not only degrade conversational clarity but also compromise […]

This commonly happens when: Since Windows assigns a unique identifier (disk signature) to each disk, if two disks have identical signatures, Windows prevents conflicts by marking one disk as Offline.

            In this post, we explain how BMW uses generative AI to speed up the root cause analysis of incidents in complex and distributed systems in the cloud such as BMW’s Connected Vehicle backend serving 23 million vehicles. Read on to learn how the solution, collaboratively pioneered by AWS and BMW, uses Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics to find root causes quicker. This post is intended for cloud solution architects and developers interested in speeding up their incident workflows.

            Generative AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o process natural language input through a series of computational steps: tokenization, numerical representation, neural processing, and text generation. While these models have achieved impressive performance in understanding and generating text, they sometimes struggle with seemingly simple tasks, such as counting letters in a word. This […] The article How Generative AI Uses Text Tokens to Generate a Response was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Did you know? The [InternalsVisibleTo] attribute in .NET is a powerful feature that allows an assembly to expose its internal members (normally only accessible within the same assembly) to another specified assembly. This is typically used in scenarios like unit testing or multi-assembly projects where tight integration between assemblies is needed. Welcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! […]

            Arrays are a key collection type in .NET. There are three methods to create empty arrays: new string[0], Array.Empty(), and the concise [] expression. Benchmark tests show the [] expression is the fastest and most memory-efficient option. For improved performance, developers should adopt this method in their codebases.
