            In this post, we announce that Mercury and Mercury Coder foundation models from Inception Labs are now available through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. We demonstrate how to deploy these ultra-fast diffusion-based language models that can generate up to 1,100 tokens per second on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and showcase their capabilities in code generation and tool use scenarios.

The new type generates code faster and reduces the code, improving readability. In this post, I will introduce the new type of source generator and compare it to

            In previous versions of the Semantic Kernel Python, the default fallback authentication mechanism for Azure services like AzureChatCompletion was DefaultAzureCredential from the Azure Identity library. This provided a convenient way to authenticate without explicitly passing credentials, especially during development.

            The tracking pointer designs we&#39;ve been using so far have had O(n) complexity on move, where n is the number of outstanding tracking pointers. But we can reduce this to O(1) by the classic technique of introducing another level of indirection. What we can do is give every trackable object

            Git worktree is a powerful feature that allows you to have multiple working directories associated with a single repository. Instead of switching branches and potentially losing uncommitted work, you can check out different branches in separate directories simultaneously without recloning the repository. Git worktree creates additional working trees linked to the same repository. Each worktree can have a…

            The Spargine library introduces ChannelQueue, an efficient, thread-safe queue for .NET asynchronous programming, addressing the lack of a built-in async queue. It supports various features like async operations, bounded capacities, cancellation, and batch processing, making it ideal for managing async data flows and enhancing application responsiveness.

            Not all abstractions are created equal. Some isolate real volatility and protect your system from change. Others quietly pile up complexity and hide performance problems. Learn when to embrace abstractions versus when they become technical debt that slows down your team.
