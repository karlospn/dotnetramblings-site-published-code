            This post dives deep into how to set up data governance at scale using Amazon DataZone for the data mesh. The data mesh is a modern approach to data management that decentralizes data ownership and treats data as a product. It enables different business units within an organization to create, share, and govern their own data assets, promoting self-service analytics and reducing the time required to convert data experiments into production-ready applications.

            In this post, we show you how to implement an audio and video segmentation solution using SageMaker Ground Truth. We guide you through deploying the necessary infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation, creating an internal labeling workforce, and setting up your first labeling job. By the end of this post, you will have a fully functional audio/video segmentation workflow that you can adapt for various use cases, from training speech synthesis models to improving video generation capabilities.

            In this post, we explore a practical, cost-effective approach for incorporating responsible AI guardrails into Amazon Bedrock Batch Inference workflows. Although we use a call center’s transcript summarization as our primary example, the methods we discuss are broadly applicable to a variety of batch inference use cases where ethical considerations and data protection are a top priority.

            Is it a bad idea to rewrite code or an entire system? At some point, developers want to rewrite for various reasons. Often, it’s because we simply don’t understand the existing codebase or think it’s a tire fire. But is the benefit there? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. It’s a pretty nuanced topic around cost/benefit. YouTube… Read More »Never rewrite code? The post Never rewrite code? appeared first on CodeOpinion.

            Caution! If you’ve built web apps with Blazor Server the following may cause distress! 😅 Attempting to reconnect to the server… Reconnection failed. Try reloading the page if you’re unable to reconnect. These are the standard Blazor error messages your users have likely complained about as they interact with your Blazor application. These errors occur because of the connected nature of Blazor server apps. A circuit runs on the server (for a given user interaction), and a SignalR (websocket) connection is maintained between the user’s browser and said circuit.

            In a recent post, I shared how to highlight C# code in string values. Roslyn provides more built-in highlighters / code-completions in string values. Most of the supported languages are available as constants of the StringSyntaxAttribute class. To indicate the language, you can use the lang or language comment or the [StringSyntax] attribute. The languages mentioned in this post are handled by Roslyn (VS,…

            In C#, method binding refers to associating a method call with the method’s code definition. When we invoke a method, the program determines which specific method to execute. This process, known as “binding,” can occur at two different times: during compile-time (early binding) or runtime (late binding). By using early binding, we can use compile-time […] The post Early Binding and Late Binding in C# appeared first on Code Maze.
