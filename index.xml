That’s right, the full-featured DataGrip database toolset isn’t just a separate product or an additional paid plugin anymore; it’s bundled into WebStorm. Even if you’re comfortable with other IDEs and their database extensions, you might find […]

            “Write less, do more.” That motto wasn’t just a clever tagline—it was a revolution. Before modern JavaScript frameworks became the norm, jQuery quietly changed everything. In the web development landscape now dominated by React, Angular, and Vue, it might be easy to forget a time when making a button click actually do something required verbose, […] The article Software Innovation: jQuery – The Tiny Library that Transformed the Web was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we highlight the advanced data augmentation techniques and performance improvements in Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation with Meta&#39;s Llama model family. This technique transfers knowledge from larger, more capable foundation models (FMs) that act as teachers to smaller, more efficient models (students), creating specialized models that excel at specific tasks.

            In this post, we present an LLM migration paradigm and architecture, including a continuous process of model evaluation, prompt generation using Amazon Bedrock, and data-aware optimization. The solution evaluates the model performance before migration and iteratively optimizes the Amazon Nova model prompts using user-provided dataset and objective metrics.

            As C# developers, we sometimes must interact dynamically with objects, fields, properties, methods, or types. Use cases such as inter-mapping between types, traversing model properties, developing an extensible system, injecting dependencies, etc., demand runtime handling. You may wonder how to tackle such scenarios. In this post, I will show you

            In this post, we demonstrate model customization (fine-tuning) for tool use with Amazon Nova. We first introduce a tool usage use case, and gave details about the dataset. We walk through the details of Amazon Nova specific data formatting and showed how to do tool calling through the Converse and Invoke APIs in Amazon Bedrock. After getting the baseline results from Amazon Nova models, we explain in detail the fine-tuning process, hosting fine-tuned models with provisioned throughput, and using the fine-tuned Amazon Nova models for inference.

            When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), generating structured outputs like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is invaluable for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and integration with spreadsheet applications. However, since LLMs are primarily optimized for natural language generation, crafting prompts that yield valid CSV-formatted data requires careful engineering. This article provides strategies and examples to […] The article How to Write AI Prompts That Output Valid CSV Data was originally published on Build5Nines.
