            We recently released some new AI features for the JetBrains Academy plugin. Learners will now be able to use machine translation of course content, theory lookup, and AI hints for Kotlin courses. At first glance, these might seem fairly tame. There are no big LLM integrations, JetBrains AI Assistant is not being marketed toward beginners, […]

            Introduction Until now, iOS developers who wanted real‑time, bi‑directional communication with SignalR had to rely on community‑built clients or roll their own Swift implementation—both of which introduced maintenance and compatibility headaches. We’re excited to announce that the official SignalR Swift client is now available in public preview. With this release, you can: Quickly add real‑time […]

            Spring Framework 6.2 introduced MockMvcTester to support writing AssertJ style assertions using AssertJ under the hood. If you’re using Spring Boot, the spring-boot-starter-test dependency transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as mockito, assertj, json-path, jsonassert, etc. So, if you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 (which uses Spring framework 6.2) or any later version, […]

            In this post, we explore the importance of evaluating LLMs in the context of generative AI applications, highlighting the challenges posed by issues like hallucinations and biases. We introduced a comprehensive solution using AWS services to automate the evaluation process, allowing for continuous monitoring and assessment of LLM performance. By using tools like the FMeval Library, Ragas, LLMeter, and Step Functions, the solution provides flexibility and scalability, meeting the evolving needs of LLM consumers.

            This article analyzes the performance of different methods for retrieving the character count of a string in .NET, recommending the use of Length as the fastest option. Length is significantly more efficient than Span and Enumerable.Count(), urging developers to refactor for improved performance while validating optimizations with BenchmarkDotNet.

            It wasn’t the first web framework. It may not be the flashiest these days in 2025. But Ruby on Rails was revolutionary when it hit the scene — and its fingerprints are still all over modern web development today. At a time when building web applications was often painful, verbose, and fractured across multiple layers […] The article Software Innovation: Ruby on Rails – The Framework that Rewired The Web with MVC and Convention was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) is a new managed feature powered by FMs in Amazon Bedrock. BDA extracts structured outputs from unstructured content—including documents, images, video, and audio—while alleviating the need for complex custom workflows. In this post, we demonstrate how BDA automatically extracts rich video insights such as chapter segments and audio segments, detects text in scenes, and classifies Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomies, and then uses these insights to build a nonlinear ads solution to enhance contextual advertising effectiveness.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to orchestrate multiple Amazon Bedrock agents to create a sophisticated Amazon EKS troubleshooting system. By enabling collaboration between specialized agents—deriving insights from K8sGPT and performing actions through the ArgoCD framework—you can build a comprehensive automation that identifies, analyzes, and resolves cluster issues with minimal human intervention.
