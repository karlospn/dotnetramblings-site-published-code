            In this post, we explore how to enable and use trusted identity propagation in Amazon SageMaker Studio, which allows organizations to simplify access management by granting permissions to existing AWS IAM Identity Center identities. The solution demonstrates how to implement fine-grained access controls based on a physical user&#39;s identity, maintain detailed audit logs across supported AWS services, and support long-running user background sessions for training jobs.

We show how these models can precisely locate and interpret document fields with minimal frontend effort, reducing processing errors and manual intervention.

This solution excels in handling multimodal data sources, seamlessly processing text, diagrams, and numerical data while maintaining context and relationships between different data elements. In this post, we provide insights on the solution and walk you through different approaches and architecture patterns explored, like different chunking, multi-vector retrieval, and hybrid search during the development.

            Proxy 4 is here! After years of innovation and sustained use in the Windows OS codebase (since 2022), Proxy has matured from a bold experiment into a production-grade, modern C++ library for runtime polymorphism. The theory behind Proxy is original, and its design is now proven at scale. We are excited to invite the broader C++ community to jo

            Building AI agents in the real world often involves more than just making model calls — it requires integrating with external tools, handling complex workflows, and ensuring the solution can scale in production. In this post, we’ll walk through a real-world developer setup for creating an agent using the Docker MCP Toolkit. To make things...

            In this post, we explore how to design and implement custom plugins for Amazon Q Business to create an intelligent chatbot that streamlines employee training by retrieving answers from training materials. The solution implements secure API access using Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization, processes multiple document formats, and includes features like RAG-enhanced responses and email escalation capabilities through custom plugins.

            In this post, we explore how to build a travel planning solution using AI agents. The agent uses Amazon Nova, which offers an optimal balance of performance and cost compared to other commercial LLMs. By combining accurate but cost-efficient Amazon Nova models with LangGraph orchestration capabilities, we create a practical travel assistant that can handle complex planning tasks while keeping operational costs manageable for production deployments.

            CVEs dominated the conversation at Black Hat 2025. Across sessions, booth discussions, and hallway chatter, it was clear that teams are feeling the pressure to manage vulnerabilities at scale. While scanning remains an important tool, the focus is shifting toward removing security debt before it enters the software supply chain. Hardened images, compliance-ready tooling, and...

            In this post, we demonstrate the implementation of a practical RAG chat-based assistant using a comprehensive stack of modern technologies. The solution uses NVIDIA NIMs for both LLM inference and text embedding services, with the NIM Operator handling their deployment and management. The architecture incorporates Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings for similarity search.

            In the blog post Scalable intelligent document processing using Amazon Bedrock, we demonstrated how to build a scalable IDP pipeline using Anthropic foundation models on Amazon Bedrock. Although that approach delivered robust performance, the introduction of Amazon Bedrock Data Automation brings a new level of efficiency and flexibility to IDP solutions. This post explores how Amazon Bedrock Data Automation enhances document processing capabilities and streamlines the automation journey.
