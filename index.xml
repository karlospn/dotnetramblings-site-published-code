            Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a spec for exposing tools, models, or services to language models through a common interface. Think of them as smart adapters: they sit between a tool and the LLM, speaking a predictable protocol that lets the model interact with things like APIs, databases, and agents without needing to know...

            The Windows Runtime has interfaces IAsync­Action and IAsync­Operation which represent asynchronous activity: The function starts the work and returns immediately, and then it calls you back when the work completes. Most language projections allow you to treat these as coroutines, so you can await

            FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing...

Developer experience (DevEx) directly correlates with engineering performance, which in turn drives competitive advantage. And yet many software engineering teams continue to operate on legacy CI/CD platforms that create unnecessary friction, burn developer hours, and ultimately limit business growth. While some teams remain trapped by […]

            Marten has very rich support for projecting events into read, write, or query models. While there are other capabilities as well, the most common usage is probably to aggregate related events into a singular view. Marten projections can be executed Live, meaning that Marten does the creation of the view by loading the target events … Continue reading Marten’s Aggregation Projection Subsystem →

When something has gone horribly wrong and requires immediate attention, one way to describe it is to say that it is on fire. The obvious metaphor here is that the situation is so severe that

            Commenter Otul Osan wondered what was happening when the user held the Shift key when restarting Windows. Windows displays the message &amp;quot;Windows is restarting&amp;quot; rather than doing a full cold restart of the system.

            When debugging or logging, you often need to know where a method is defined in your source code. While .NET provides caller information attributes like [CallerMemberName], [CallerFilePath], and [CallerLineNumber], these only work at compile-time and require you to add parameters to your methods. What if you want to retrieve source file information for any method at runtime? One use-case is…

            The IntelliJ Platform provides a powerful debugger framework that plugins can extend to support various programming languages and runtime environments. To enable remote development scenarios – where the IDE interface runs on your local machine while code executes on a remote server – we’ve redesigned the debugger architecture. This guide walks you through the changes […]

The solution uses Duende IdentityServer as the OpenID Connect provider and ASP.NET Core Identity for user management. Identity verification is performed using the Swiyu Public Beta infrastructure. Any OpenID Connect client can consume the loi claim together with the loa […]

            In this post, we show you how fine-tuning enabled a 33% reduction in dangerous medication errors (Amazon Pharmacy), engineering 80% human effort reduction (Amazon Global Engineering Services), and content quality assessments improving 77% to 96% accuracy (Amazon A+). This post details the techniques behind these outcomes: from foundational methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (instruction tuning), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for human alignment, to cutting-edge reasoning optimizations such as Grouped-based Reinforcement Learning from Policy Optimization (GRPO), Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), and Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) purpose-built for agentic systems.

            Palo Alto Networks’ Device Security team wanted to detect early warning signs of potential production issues to provide more time to SMEs to react to these emerging problems. They partnered with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) to develop an automated log classification pipeline powered by Amazon Bedrock. In this post, we discuss how Amazon Bedrock, through Anthropic’ s Claude Haiku model, and Amazon Titan Text Embeddings work together to automatically classify and analyze log data.

            In this post, we explain how we overcame the limitations of single-agent AI systems through a human-centric approach, implemented structured outputs to significantly reduce hallucinations and built a scalable solution now positioned for expansion across the AMET QA team and later across other QA teams in International Emerging Stores and Payments (IESP) Org.

            In this post, we describe how you can use Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings to retrieve specific video segments. We also review a real-world use case in which Nova Multimodal Embeddings achieved a recall success rate of 96.7% and a high-precision recall of 73.3% (returning the target content in the top two results) when tested against a library of 170 gaming creative assets. The model also demonstrates strong cross-language capabilities with minimal performance degradation across multiple languages.
