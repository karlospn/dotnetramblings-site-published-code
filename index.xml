            I’m not a competitive programmer – far from it. I never received formal education in advanced algorithms and data structures. In fact, I can’t even implement Dijkstra’s algorithm without referring to Wikipedia. Yet, I still participate in Advent of Code competitions. I’ve never made it onto an official leaderboard; I’m too slow for that. Completing […]

            In this post, we demonstrate Embodied AI Chess with Amazon Bedrock, bringing a new dimension to traditional chess through generative AI capabilities. Our setup features a smart chess board that can detect moves in real time, paired with two robotic arms executing those moves. Each arm is controlled by different FMs—base or custom. This physical implementation allows you to observe and experiment with how different generative AI models approach complex gaming strategies in real-world chess matches.

            For those familiar with the JsonAdDomain extension, it provides an easy way to join VMs to your domain. However, one aspect that customers have been less crazy about is that the domain password must be shared in the protected settings (where it is at least encrypted) and, more importantly, the functionality of the extension doesn’t […]

            One great advantage of VM Applications is the ability to specify how many replicas you want for each VM Application version. While documentation exists on how to specify replicas, we don’t really provide advice on determining how many replicas to use. The goal of this post is to rectify that gap. First, the basics.

            In this post, we demonstrate how the Amazon SageMaker model parallel library (SMP) addresses this need through support for new features such as 8-bit floating point (FP8) mixed-precision training for accelerated training performance and context parallelism for processing large input sequence lengths, expanding the list of its existing features.

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Agents simplify the orchestration of generative AI workflows, particularly with the introduction of the custom orchestrator feature. You can use the custom orchestrator to fine-tune and optimize agentic workflows that align more closely with specific business and operational needs. We outline the feature’s key benefits, including full control over orchestration, real-time adjustments, and reusability, followed by a breakdown of how it manages state transitions and contract-based interactions between Amazon Bedrock Agents and AWS Lambda.

            For enterprises in the realm of cloud computing and software development, providing secure code repositories is essential. As sophisticated cybersecurity threats become more prevalent, organizations must adopt proactive measures to protect their assets. Amazon Bedrock offers a powerful solution by automating the process of scanning repositories for vulnerabilities and remediating them. This post explores how you can use Amazon Bedrock to enhance the security of your repositories and maintain compliance with organizational and regulatory standards.

            .NET 9 introduces a new NuGet dependency graph resolver that dramatically improves package restore performance for large repositories. Learn how this reimagined approach reduces restore times from 30 minutes to just 2 minutes by creating a more efficient dependency graph with fewer nodes.

            This post demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Knowledge Bases, and the RAGAS evaluation metrics to build a custom hallucination detector and remediate it by using human-in-the-loop. The agentic workflow can be extended to custom use cases through different hallucination remediation techniques and offers the flexibility to detect and mitigate hallucinations using custom actions.

            In this post, we walk through the steps to deploy the Meta Llama 3.1-8B model on Inferentia 2 instances using Amazon EKS. This solution combines the exceptional performance and cost-effectiveness of Inferentia 2 chips with the robust and flexible landscape of Amazon EKS. Inferentia 2 chips deliver high throughput and low latency inference, ideal for LLMs.

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can address the challenges of model customization being complex, time-consuming, and often expensive by using fully managed environment with Amazon SageMaker Training jobs to fine-tune the Mixtral 8x7B model using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) and Quantized Low Rank Adaptation (QLoRA).

            G6e instances on SageMaker unlock the ability to deploy a wide variety of open source models cost-effectively. With superior memory capacity, enhanced performance, and cost-effectiveness, these instances represent a compelling solution for organizations looking to deploy and scale their AI applications. The ability to handle larger models, support longer context lengths, and maintain high throughput makes G6e instances particularly valuable for modern AI applications.

            This post discusses how to use AWS Step Functions to efficiently coordinate multi-step generative AI workflows, such as parallelizing API calls to Amazon Bedrock to quickly gather answers to lists of submitted questions. We also touch on the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to optimize outputs and provide an extra layer of precision, as well as other possible integrations through Step Functions.

            In this post, we demonstrate the potential of large language model (LLM) debates using a supervised dataset with ground truth. In this post, we navigate the LLM debating technique with persuasive LLMs having two expert debater LLMs (Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet and Mixtral 8X7B) and one judge LLM (Mistral 7B v2 to measure, compare, and contrast its performance against other techniques like self-consistency (with naive and expert judges) and LLM consultancy.

            This post dives deep into how to set up data governance at scale using Amazon DataZone for the data mesh. The data mesh is a modern approach to data management that decentralizes data ownership and treats data as a product. It enables different business units within an organization to create, share, and govern their own data assets, promoting self-service analytics and reducing the time required to convert data experiments into production-ready applications.

            Today we excited to announce the availability of TypeScript 5.7! If you’re not familiar with TypeScript, it’s a language that builds on JavaScript by adding syntax for type declarations and annotations. This syntax can be used by the TypeScript compiler to type-check our code, and it can also be erased to emit clean, idiomatic JavaScript […]
