            In this post, we show how ML engineers familiar with Jupyter notebooks and SageMaker environments can efficiently work with DevOps engineers familiar with Kubernetes and related tools to design and maintain an ML pipeline with the right infrastructure for their organization. This enables DevOps engineers to manage all the steps of the ML lifecycle with the same set of tools and environment they are used to.

            In this post, we show you how Thomson Reuters Labs (TR Labs) was able to develop an efficient, flexible, and powerful MLOps process by adopting a standardized MLOps framework that uses AWS SageMaker, SageMaker Experiments, SageMaker Model Registry, and SageMaker Pipelines. The goal being to accelerate how quickly teams can experiment and innovate using AI and machine learning (ML)—whether using natural language processing (NLP), generative AI, or other techniques. We discuss how this has helped decrease the time to market for fresh ideas and helped build a cost-efficient machine learning lifecycle.

            The application of code rules is often conveyed as unidirectional and one-size-fits-all. In other words, when we learn to develop, we tend to read that there is only one way to produce quality code, and only one way to implement rules or patterns.With this series of articles, we aim

            When developing web applications using ASP.NET Core, we frequently encounter scenarios where we need to manage collections of strings. These collections can originate from various sources, such as HTTP headers, query strings, form data, and configuration settings. Efficiently handling these collections is crucial for maintaining the performance and scalability of our web applications. That’s where […] The post StringValues in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

            This post shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core application which uses OpenID Connect and OAuth PAR for authentication. The client application uses Keycloak as the identity provider. The Keycloak application is hosted in a docker container. The applications are run locally using .NET Aspire. This makes it really easy to develop using containers. Code: […]
