            In this post, we explore the importance of evaluating LLMs in the context of generative AI applications, highlighting the challenges posed by issues like hallucinations and biases. We introduced a comprehensive solution using AWS services to automate the evaluation process, allowing for continuous monitoring and assessment of LLM performance. By using tools like the FMeval Library, Ragas, LLMeter, and Step Functions, the solution provides flexibility and scalability, meeting the evolving needs of LLM consumers.

            Microsoft Learn has a growing list of Power Platform training modules. Based on community feedback, we’ve added a new learning path: Work with Power Fx functions. Power Fx functions enable the creation of server-side business logic using Power Fx, a low-code, declarative language. These functions were previously called instant low-code plug-ins. They provide reusable, parameterized […]

            This article analyzes the performance of different methods for retrieving the character count of a string in .NET, recommending the use of Length as the fastest option. Length is significantly more efficient than Span and Enumerable.Count(), urging developers to refactor for improved performance while validating optimizations with BenchmarkDotNet.

            It wasn’t the first web framework. It may not be the flashiest these days in 2025. But Ruby on Rails was revolutionary when it hit the scene — and its fingerprints are still all over modern web development today. At a time when building web applications was often painful, verbose, and fractured across multiple layers […] The article Software Innovation: Ruby on Rails – The Framework that Rewired The Web with MVC and Convention was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) is a new managed feature powered by FMs in Amazon Bedrock. BDA extracts structured outputs from unstructured content—including documents, images, video, and audio—while alleviating the need for complex custom workflows. In this post, we demonstrate how BDA automatically extracts rich video insights such as chapter segments and audio segments, detects text in scenes, and classifies Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomies, and then uses these insights to build a nonlinear ads solution to enhance contextual advertising effectiveness.
