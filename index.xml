            AWS provides a powerful tool called AWS Support Automation Workflows, which is a collection of curated AWS Systems Manager self-service automation runbooks. These runbooks are created by AWS Support Engineering with best practices learned from solving customer issues. They enable AWS customers to troubleshoot, diagnose, and remediate common issues with their AWS resources. In this post, we explore how to use the power of Amazon Bedrock Agents and AWS Support Automation Workflows to create an intelligent agent capable of troubleshooting issues with AWS resources.

            In this post, we explore why Asure used the Amazon Web Services (AWS) post-call analytics (PCA) pipeline that generated insights across call centers at scale with the advanced capabilities of generative AI-powered services such as Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q in QuickSight. Asure chose this approach because it provided in-depth consumer analytics, categorized call transcripts around common themes, and empowered contact center leaders to use natural language to answer queries. This ultimately allowed Asure to provide its customers with improvements in product and customer experiences.

            Over the past 5 years, we’ve had many incredible opportunities to engage with game developers. From AAA studios to indie developers, the passion for slashing iteration times is significant. Amidst all the fantastic feedback we’ve received for Visual Studio, one sentiment has rung loud and clear: a desire to debug optimized C++ code without sacrificing […]

            If you’ve used any applications that required connecting your personal Microsoft or Entra ID account, you’re probably familiar with the typical “authentication dance” – you see a browser window pop up, you enter your credentials, then you can close the browser, and the application is magically authenticated. The next application you launch does the same […]

            Today, we’re announcing a significant enhancement to Amazon Bedrock Guardrails: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy-based enforcement. This powerful capability enables security and compliance teams to establish mandatory guardrails for every model inference call, making sure organizational safety policies are consistently enforced across AI interactions. This feature enhances AI governance by enabling centralized control over guardrail implementation.

            Slow build times are a major headache for developers, especially in large, complex C++ codebases like game engines. Every minute spent waiting on a build is time that could be used to refine features, resolve issues, or push development forward. Activision faced this challenge with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, where prolonged build times […]

            Healthcare decisions often require integrating information from multiple sources, such as medical literature, clinical databases, and patient records. LLMs lack the ability to seamlessly access and synthesize data from these diverse and distributed sources. This limits their potential to provide comprehensive and well-informed insights for healthcare applications. In this blog post, we will explore how Mistral LLM on Amazon Bedrock can address these challenges and enable the development of intelligent healthcare agents with LLM function calling capabilities, while maintaining robust data security and privacy through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.
