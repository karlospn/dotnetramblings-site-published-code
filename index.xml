            Just to see what happens, a customer called Set­ClipboardData(CF_TEXT) and passed a memory block that was intentionally not null-terminated. They found that when they subsequently pasted the string (say, into Notepad), the last character didn&#39;t get pasted. As a second experiment, they over-allocated the buffer b

            Created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and first released in 1995, Ruby arrived with a purpose that was simple but profound: to make coding more human, more intuitive, and more enjoyable. Its object-oriented model, dynamic typing, and elegant syntax offered a fresh alternative to the heavier and more complex languages of that era. As Ruby marks […]

            In this post, we explore how to programmatically create an IDP solution that uses Strands SDK, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, and Bedrock Data Automation (BDA). This solution is provided through a Jupyter notebook that enables users to upload multi-modal business documents and extract insights using BDA as a parser to retrieve relevant chunks and augment a prompt to a foundational model (FM).

            Enterprise organizations increasingly rely on web-based applications for critical business processes, yet many workflows remain manually intensive, creating operational inefficiencies and compliance risks. Despite significant technology investments, knowledge workers routinely navigate between eight to twelve different web applications during standard workflows, constantly switching contexts and manually transferring information between systems. Data entry and validation tasks […]

Virtual threads map multiple concurrent I/O operations to a single OS thread without blocking. The novel aspect of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to the codebase, as […]

            Thank you to everyone who joined Advent of Code 2025 in Rust! It was inspiring to see many Rustaceans solving algorithmic puzzles, and celebrating the holiday coding season with the community. Before the Advent began, Vitaly Bragilevsky published a blog post on how to use AI in Advent of Code challenge responsibly and effectively. This […]

            This post explores Chain-of-Draft (CoD), an innovative prompting technique introduced in a Zoom AI Research paper Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less, that revolutionizes how models approach reasoning tasks. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been the go-to method for enhancing model reasoning, CoD offers a more efficient alternative that mirrors human problem-solving patterns—using concise, high-signal thinking steps rather than verbose explanations.

            In this post, we demonstrate hosting Voxtral models on Amazon SageMaker AI endpoints using vLLM and the Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) approach. vLLM is a high-performance library for serving large language models (LLMs) that features paged attention for improved memory management and tensor parallelism for distributing models across multiple GPUs.

            To address the need for businesses to quickly analyze information and unlock actionable insights, we are announcing Analytics Agent, a new feature that is seamlessly integrated into the GenAI IDP Accelerator. With this feature, users can perform advanced searches and complex analyses using natural language queries without SQL or data analysis expertise. In this post, we discuss how non-technical users can use this tool to analyze and understand the documents they have processed at scale with natural language.

When you download a file, Windows automatically adds a special metadata tag indicating the file originated from an untrusted source and may contain harmful content. Windows components such as Microsoft Edge and Windows Explorer use MOTW to determine…

            Microsoft advises initializing reference type static fields inline to enhance code readability and prevent issues from uninitialized fields. Two patterns are shown: inline initialization and using a static constructor. While both methods do not allocate memory, using a static constructor may slightly improve performance. EditorConfig can check for adherence to this guideline.

            OpenAI introduces a new framework and evaluation suite for chain-of-thought monitorability, covering 13 evaluations across 24 environments. Our findings show that monitoring a model’s internal reasoning is far more effective than monitoring outputs alone, offering a promising path toward scalable control as AI systems grow more capable.
