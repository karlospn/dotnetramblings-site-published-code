            Long build times are one of the top pain points for C++ projects. If you’ve ever waited too long for a C++ build to finish, you know how much it can slow down your productivity. In past years, we introduced C++ Build Insights to help you analyze traces and find bottlenecks. However, we know that

            The phrase “bad code” gets thrown around in reviews and online forums all the time. But what does it actually mean? It’s a good example of the vague terms that occasionally make the rounds in developer circles without much to qualify them. We’ve collected opinions on the subject, metrics, and code risks that you can […]

            Docker Desktop 4.50 represents a major leap forward in how development teams build, secure, and ship software. Across the last several releases, we&#39;ve delivered meaningful improvements that directly address the challenges you face every day: faster debugging workflows, enterprise-grade security controls that don&#39;t get in your way, and seamless AI integration that makes modern development...

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can use the A2A protocol for AI agents built with different frameworks to collaborate seamlessly. You&#39;ll learn how to deploy A2A servers on AgentCore Runtime, configure agent discovery and authentication, and build a real-world multi-agent system for incident response. We&#39;ll cover the complete A2A request lifecycle, from agent card discovery to task delegation, showing how standardized protocols eliminate the complexity of multi-agent coordination.

            The Cohere Embed 4 multimodal embeddings model is now available as a fully managed, serverless option in Amazon Bedrock. In this post, we dive into the benefits and unique capabilities of Embed 4 for enterprise search use cases. We’ll show you how to quickly get started using Embed 4 on Amazon Bedrock, taking advantage of integrations with Strands Agents, S3 Vectors, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build powerful agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

            The regulatory landscape for GxP compliance is evolving to address the unique characteristics of AI. Traditional Computer System Validation (CSV) approaches, often with uniform validation strategies, are being supplemented by Computer Software Assurance (CSA) frameworks that emphasize flexible risk-based validation methods tailored to each system&#39;s actual impact and complexity (FDA latest guidance). In this post, we cover a risk-based implementation, practical implementation considerations across different risk levels, the AWS shared responsibility model for compliance, and concrete examples of risk mitigation strategies.

            We’ve all had bloated CQRS handlers. You open up a command, query, or event handler, and it’s a bloated mess. It’s a nightmare of code. There’s validation, authorization, state changes, side effects, logging, it’s a mess to maintain and it’s really hard to test.

            Whenever possible, Windows 95 made application compatibility tweaks through things like compatibility flags that alter the behavior of the system for any program the flag was applied to. Using compatibility flags allows the fix to be generalized: If one program has a problem, there&#39;s a good chance that another program will also have that sa

            In just a year, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to tools and external systems. The Docker MCP Catalog now hosts hundreds of containerized local MCP servers, enabling developers to quickly experiment and prototype locally. We have now added support for remote MCP servers to the Docker MCP...

            Building agents is weird. You’re not writing code that does things. You’re writing code that gives an LLM the ability to do things, and the LLM decides what to do. What is an agent? An agent is an LLM that calls your functions in a loop until it decides the task is complete. That shift […]

Some are extremely powerful but painful to write, while others are friendly but struggle with large files. You probably come across OpenXML, EPPlus,

            In this post, we demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs provides a powerful and flexible approach to automate and significantly enhance document understanding capabilities. We also demonstrate that using focused fine-tuning allows smaller, multi-modal models to compete effectively with much larger counterparts (98% accuracy with Qwen2.5 VL 3B).

            C# has long supported extension methods, allowing developers to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. However, this capability was limited to instance methods. With C# 14, the language introduces extension members, significantly expanding what you can extend. You can now add extension properties and extension static methods to existing types. This enhancement is…

      <title>Defensive Programming Rule #3: Validate Your Enums (Every Time)</title>

            Enums enhance code readability but can lead to errors if not validated, as any integer can be cast as an Enum, including invalid values. Validating Enum inputs prevents silent data corruption, ensures meaningful defaults, and avoids processing impossible states. Always validate at method boundaries and define a zero value as &amp;quot;unknown.&amp;quot;

            Distributed systems don&#39;t fail cleanly: they retry, duplicate, and occasionally fail. This article shows how to design resilient message handlers in .NET using broker-level idempotency and the Idempotent Consumer pattern, so your system stays consistent no matter how many times a message is delivered.

            The USB MIDI 1.0 specification was released in the late 90s around the same time that PCs were starting to move from rectangular beige boxes to things like fake-silvered bulbous plastic shapes. At this point, some of the code in Windows to support USB MIDI 1.0 has become intergenerational – it&#39;s certainly older than my teenagers here at h

We&#39;ll explain how TR used AWS services to build this solution, including how the architecture was designed, the use cases it solves, and the business profiles that use it.

            Today, we are excited to announce the addition of structured output to Custom Model Import. Structured output constrains a model&#39;s generation process in real time so that every token it produces conforms to a schema you define. Rather than relying on prompt-engineering tricks or brittle post-processing scripts, you can now generate structured outputs directly at inference time.

            Generic DevSecOps advice may sound good on paper, but it often fails in practice because it ignores team context, workflow, and environment-specific needs. Overloaded controls, broad policies, and misapplied tools disrupt the flow of development. And once flow breaks, security measures are the first to get bypassed. The way forward isn&#39;t more rules but smarter...

Moving from prototype to production is hard—especially when orchestrating dozens or hundreds of specialized agents. Commercial viability depends on intentional design, scalability, latency control, and predictable outcomes.

            The MCP protocol is almost one year old and during that time, developers have built thousands of new MCP servers. Thinking back to MCP demos from six months ago, most developers were using one or two local MCP servers, each contributing just a handful of tools. Six months later and we have access to thousands...

            Earlier this year, we introduced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, a fully managed service that serves as a centralized MCP tool server, providing a unified interface where agents can discover, access, and invoke tools. Today, we&#39;re extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational complexity of maintaining separate gateways, while providing the same centralized tool and authentication management that existed for REST APIs and AWS Lambda functions.

            In this post, we show you how Amazon Search optimized GPU instance utilization by leveraging AWS Batch for SageMaker Training jobs. This managed solution enabled us to orchestrate machine learning (ML) training workloads on GPU-accelerated instance families like P5, P4, and others. We will also provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the use case implementation.
