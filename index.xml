            Amazon SageMaker HyperPod clusters with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) orchestration now support creating and managing interactive development environments such as JupyterLab and open source Visual Studio Code, streamlining the ML development lifecycle by providing managed environments for familiar tools to data scientists. This post shows how HyperPod administrators can configure Spaces for their clusters, and how data scientists can create and connect to these Spaces.

            On November 21, 2025, security researchers detected the beginning of what would become one of the most aggressive npm supply chain attacks to date. The Shai Hulud 2.0 campaign compromised over 25,000 GitHub repositories within 72 hours, targeting packages from major organizations including Zapier, ENS Domains, PostHog, and Postman. The malware&#39;s self-propagating design created a...

            A customer reported that their program encountered rendering problems when they created elements that were a half billion pixels tall, and they wondered why this was happening. A half billion pixels is an awful lot of pixels. At 96 pixels per inch, that gives you an element whose height is over 82 miles (132 km). There is no monitor

            Naming resources in Azure shouldn’t feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. Yet, without a solid standard, names can quickly become inconsistent, confusing, and downright chaotic. The result? A messy Azure environment that’s hard to search, manage, and govern. This guide will show you exactly how to establish and enforce Azure naming conventions using the open source Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform module — […] The article How To Automate Azure Naming Conventions with the Build5Nines/naming/azure Terraform Module was originally published on Build5Nines.

            In this post, we introduce the Multi-Provider Generative AI Gateway reference architecture, which provides guidance for deploying LiteLLM into an AWS environment to streamline the management and governance of production generative AI workloads across multiple model providers. This centralized gateway solution addresses common enterprise challenges including provider fragmentation, decentralized governance, operational complexity, and cost management by offering a unified interface that supports Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and external providers while maintaining comprehensive security, monitoring, and control capabilities.

            On November 19, 2025, the Golang project published two Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the widely-used golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package. While neither vulnerability received a critical CVSS score, both presented real risks to applications using SSH functionality in Go-based containers. CVE-2025-58181 affects SSH servers parsing GSSAPI authentication requests. The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger unbounded memory...

            In this post, you&#39;ll learn how to deploy geospatial AI agents that can answer complex spatial questions in minutes instead of months. By combining Foursquare Spatial H3 Hub&#39;s analysis-ready geospatial data with reasoning models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can build agents that enable nontechnical domain experts to perform sophisticated spatial analysis through natural language queries—without requiring geographic information system (GIS) expertise or custom data engineering pipelines.

            Say you need to transfer a large amount of data between two processes. One way is to use shared memory. Is that the fastest way to do it? Can you do any better? One argument against shared memory is that the sender will have to copy the data into the shared memory block, and the recipient will have to copy it out, resulting in two e

            Ever year or so, a new version of .NET ships, and I need to upgrade the .NET SDK version on my machines. Not just the Windows machines, but also the WSL Ubuntu bits that live on those same machines. First, determine what version of dotnet you already have using this:
1 2
dotnet --version
10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107
Yep, I need to update that. But how? Surely there must be a simple way to do it using just the command line.

MCP unlocks powerful, flexible workflows by letting agents tap into external tools and systems. But with thousands of MCP servers (including remote ones) now available, it’s easy to ask: Where do...

            RoboTic-Tac-Toe is an interactive game where two physical robots move around a tic-tac-toe board, with both the gameplay and robots’ movements orchestrated by LLMs. Players can control the robots using natural language commands, directing them to place their markers on the game board. In this post, we explore the architecture and prompt engineering techniques used to reason about a tic-tac-toe game and decide the next best game strategy and movement plan for the current player.

            Upgrading an old .NET app doesn’t have to mean chasing broken builds and cryptic errors. Yet for many developers, a simple version bump turns into hours of dependency conflicts and manual fixes. Modernization isn’t just about staying current. Older frameworks can introduce security risks, slow performance, and block cloud adoptio

There’s two sides to this challenge: Model creation and optimization: making fine-tuning and quantization efficient. Model...
