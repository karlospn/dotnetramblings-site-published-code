            We recently released Koog 0.5.0, introducing full Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol support, which makes it easier than ever to build systems of interconnected AI agents in Kotlin. But A2A is just the beginning. Koog 0.5.0 brings a host of improvements that make agents more persistent, tools smarter, and strategy design more intuitive. Let’s dive into the […]

            Organizations often face challenges when implementing single-shot fine-tuning approaches for their generative AI models. The single-shot fine-tuning method involves selecting training data, configuring hyperparameters, and hoping the results meet expectations without the ability to make incremental adjustments. Single-shot fine-tuning frequently leads to suboptimal results and requires starting the entire process from scratch when improvements are […]

            In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory transforms raw conversational data into persistent, actionable knowledge through sophisticated extraction, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms that mirror human cognitive processes. The system tackles the complex challenge of building AI agents that don&#39;t just store conversations but extract meaningful insights, merge related information across time, and maintain coherent memory stores that enable truly context-aware interactions.

            At Docker, we are building our hardened images to exacting standards. That means carefully crafting by hand, because humans are still the best security architects. That said, we understand the value of AI and deploy it as an extra set of eyes at critical junctures in our Docker Hardened Image (DHI) build process. With this...

            When managing reference counts, there is an asymmetry between incrementing and decrementing: Incrementing the reference count can use relaxed semantics, but decrementing requires release semantics (and destroying requires acquire semantics). The asymmetry may strike you as odd, but maybe it shouldn&#39;t. After all, it&#39;s not surprising

            ReSharper for Visual Studio Code has been available on the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace for some time now. However, ReSharper didn’t appear in many VS Code-compatible editors because these editors aren’t able to connect directly to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. For this reason, users of such editors who wanted to install ReSharper had to […]

            @ChenCravat In an old version of Windows (Windows 98 iirc) if you took screenshot of a video from media player and paste it into paint, and resume media player, video would play inside paint. Do you why it happened? It is still bugging me to this day.

            Models are advancing quickly. GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini. Each release gives us more capabilities. But most real work isn’t solved by a single model. Developers are realizing they need a system of agents: different types of agents working together to accomplish more complex tasks. For example, a researcher to find information, a writer to summarize,...

            In the world of .NET, memory management is an important aspect of any application. Fortunately, you don&#39;t have to shoulder this immense task yourself. .NET handles it with the superpower of the Garbage Collector (GC). A GC is an engine that keeps your app fast, responsive, and resource-efficient.
