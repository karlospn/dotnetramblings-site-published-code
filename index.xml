            In previous posts in this series I&#39;ve shown how to call LLMs with C# using the Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package. In this post I want to look at how you can enable the LLM to make calls into your own C# code by giving it &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; it can use. And we&#39;ll also discuss some of the security implications as this can open up a number of concerning attack vectors. There are a number of reasons you might want to give an LLM the ability to call a tool.

            .env files are widely used to configure applications by storing configuration settings, environment variables, and sensitive information. This eliminates the need to hardcode these values into the application code. Previously, developers using PhpStorm had to manually install the .env Files Support plugin, originally created by Adel Faizrakhmanov, to unlock dedicated features for working with these […]

            In this post, we show how to extend Amazon Bedrock Agents to hybrid and edge services such as AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones to build distributed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with on-premises data for improved model outcomes. With Outposts, we also cover a reference pattern for a fully local RAG application that requires both the foundation model (FM) and data sources to reside on premises.

            The research team at AWS has worked extensively on building and evaluating the multi-agent collaboration (MAC) framework so customers can orchestrate multiple AI agents on Amazon Bedrock Agents. In this post, we explore the concept of multi-agent collaboration (MAC) and its benefits, as well as the key components of our MAC framework. We also go deeper into our evaluation methodology and present insights from our studies.

            Aren’t you tired of adding manual logs to your HTTP APIs to log HTTP requests and responses? By using a built-in middleware in ASP.NET, you will be able to centralize logs management and have a clear view of all the incoming HTTP requests.

            HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security feature that indicates a client to only connect to a website over HTTPS. Websites can set the Strict-Transport-Security header to inform the client to always use HTTPS. ASP.NET Core can easily set the header, but there is no built-in feature to enable HSTS for an HttpClient. In this post, I describe how to create an HttpClient that supports HSTS,…

            The article highlights the persistent issue of failing to call Dispose() on disposable objects in .NET projects, which leads to memory leaks and system instability. The author recommends using IDisposableAnalyzers and memory profilers to detect these issues, alongside custom extension methods for easier disposal management, advocating for proactive solutions to maintain application performance.

Each AI provider will have its own pricing structure for the various models it offers. For example, here are pricing pages for Azure OpenAI service, OpenAI&#39;s own API, Anthropic&#39;s API, Google Gemini API, DeepSeek API, Amazon Bedrock, and xAI Grok.
