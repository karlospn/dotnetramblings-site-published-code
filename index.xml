            Microsoft advises initializing reference type static fields inline to enhance code readability and prevent issues from uninitialized fields. Two patterns are shown: inline initialization and using a static constructor. While both methods do not allocate memory, using a static constructor may slightly improve performance. EditorConfig can check for adherence to this guideline.

            2025 was the year software teams stopped optimizing models and started optimizing systems. By December, a few truths were impossible to ignore. 1. Developer Productivity Became the Real Competitive Advantage By mid-year, every major AI lab had cleared the “good enough reasoning” bar. With model quality converging, the differentiator was no longer raw intelligence. It...

            Security vulnerabilities don&#39;t fix themselves. Someone needs to track them, prioritize them, and actually ship the fix. If you&#39;ve ever tried to manage security alerts alongside your regular sprint work, though, you know the friction: you&#39;re looking at an alert in one tab, switching to your backlog in another, trying to remember which vulner

            Today, we are excited to introduce a new feature for SageMaker Studio: SOCI (Seekable Open Container Initiative) indexing. SOCI supports lazy loading of container images, where only the necessary parts of an image are downloaded initially rather than the entire container.

            Say you have a shortcut file and you want to see what its target is. The natural thing to do is to call IShellLink::GetPath, which returns S_FALSE if the shortcut does not target a path, or returns S_OK and a path to the target. But for some shortcuts, it returns S_OK but produces a

            Adopting Kotlin in a Java-centric company is not about flipping a switch or rewriting everything “the right way”. It’s about people, timing, risk, and trust. Over the last four weeks, we’ve published a series of blog posts by Urs Peter, covering all of these aspects of migrating to Kotlin. In this post, we’ll tie the […]

            OpenAI introduces a new framework and evaluation suite for chain-of-thought monitorability, covering 13 evaluations across 24 environments. Our findings show that monitoring a model’s internal reasoning is far more effective than monitoring outputs alone, offering a promising path toward scalable control as AI systems grow more capable.

            Picture this: Your enterprise has just deployed its first generative AI application. The initial results are promising, but as you plan to scale across departments, critical questions emerge. How will you enforce consistent security, prevent model bias, and maintain control as AI applications multiply?

            Running large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models can be a complex, frustrating process of managing dependencies, drivers, and environments. At Docker, we believe this should be as simple as docker model run. That&#39;s why we built Docker Model Runner, and today, we’re thrilled to announce a new collaboration with Universal Blue. Thanks...

            C and C++ are the backbone of modern software. Operating systems, databases, game engines, and compilers all trace their roots to these languages. They give developers low-level control over memory, hardware, and performance. It’s a level of control that has defined decades of software development. However, the landscape has shifted, and the Rust vs. C++ […]

            Over the past few weeks, after we announced ACP protocol support, I’ve gotten lots of messages asking something along these lines: “Microsoft just launched AgentHQ for GitHub and VS Code. So, does this mean JetBrains will drop ACP? Will you only support your own thing now?” The quick answer: We’re not picking sides. Here’s why – […]

            In this post, we introduce checkpointless training on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a paradigm shift in model training that reduces the need for traditional checkpointing by enabling peer-to-peer state recovery. Results from production-scale validation show 80–93% reduction in recovery time (from 15–30 minutes or more to under 2 minutes) and enables up to 95% training goodput on cluster sizes with thousands of AI accelerators.
