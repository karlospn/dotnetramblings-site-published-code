            In this post, we demonstrated how a financial services company can use an FM to process large volumes of customer records and get specific data-driven product recommendations. We also showed how to implement an automated monitoring solution for Amazon Bedrock batch inference jobs. By using EventBridge, Lambda, and DynamoDB, you can gain real-time visibility into batch processing operations, so you can efficiently generate personalized product recommendations based on customer credit data.

But achieving that ideal is harder than it sounds, because paradoxes exist at every step. Developers patch quickly, yet new CVEs appear faster than fixes can ship. Organizations standardize on...

            When working with network programming in .NET, you might need to find an available port on your system. This is particularly useful when creating server applications, running tests, or developing tools that need to bind to a network port without conflicts. Here&#39;s a simple way to get an available port using the Socket class: Socket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream,…

            We&#39;ve all been there: you&#39;re 90% of the way through downloading a massive, multi-gigabyte GGUF model file for llama.cpp when your internet connection hiccups. The download fails, and the progress bar resets to zero. It&#39;s a frustrating experience that wastes time, bandwidth, and momentum. Well, the llama.cpp community has just shipped a fantastic quality-of-life improvement...

            If you’ve ever tried building a system of multiple AI agents, you’ve probably run into the problem. It starts simple enough: You’ve got one agent writing blog posts, another proofreading them, and maybe a third suggesting or generating images. Individually, they’re effective. But getting them to work together? That’s where things might start falling apart. […]

            It’s 2 AM in a lab somewhere. A researcher has three terminals open, a half-written Jupyter notebook on one screen, an Excel sheet filled with sample IDs on another, and a half-eaten snack next to shell commands. They’re juggling scripts to run a protein folding model, parsing CSVs from the last experiment, searching for literature,...

When C++ introduced the concept of clocks in C++11, it did not require clocks to have any particular epoch. In C++20, th

Agents are not just chatbots or copilots — they are autonomous software components that can reason about goals, call tools and APIs, collaborate with other agents, and adapt dynamically.

            ArrayPool optimizes memory usage by providing a thread-safe pool of reusable arrays, significantly reducing allocations and garbage collection pressure, especially in high-performance scenarios. It&#39;s effective for I/O, serialization, and media processing. Best practices include tight scope management, clearing sensitive data on return, and careful tracking of logical array lengths.

            To the best of my recollection and internet sleuthing today, development on Marten started in October of 2015 after my then colleague Corey Kaylor had kicked around an idea the previous summer to utilize the new JSONB feature in PostgreSQL 9.4 as a way to replace our then problematic usage of a third party NoSQL … Continue reading Celebrating Marten’s 10th Birthday! →

            In this post, we demonstrate how to implement real-time fraud prevention using GraphStorm v0.5&#39;s new capabilities for deploying graph neural network (GNN) models through Amazon SageMaker. We show how to transition from model training to production-ready inference endpoints with minimal operational overhead, enabling sub-second fraud detection on transaction graphs with billions of nodes and edges.

            TL;DR Over the past few years, AI has made remarkable progress, but it doesn’t always deliver what professional developers need. One key reason is that most models are trained on public datasets that don’t reflect the complex, real-world scenarios faced by professional developers every day. Without such real-world data, our AI tools will fall short. […]

            Sora 2 is our new state of the art video and audio generation model. Building on the foundation of Sora, this new model introduces capabilities that have been difficult for prior video models to achieve– such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio, enhanced steerability, and an expanded stylistic range.
