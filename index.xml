            Building upon our earlier work of marketing campaign image generation using Amazon Nova foundation models, in this post, we demonstrate how to enhance image generation by learning from previous marketing campaigns. We explore how to integrate Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to create an advanced image generation system that uses reference campaigns to maintain brand guidelines, deliver consistent content, and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of new campaign creation.

            If you spend time in the Azure Portal’s using Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer, you know it’s a “lots of screens, lots of tabs, lots of work happening” kind of place. So I’m excited to share a small upgrade that makes a big difference: Dark Mode is now supported in Cosmos DB Data Explorer.

            In this post, we illustrate how Clarus Care, a healthcare contact center solutions provider, worked with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) team to develop a generative AI-powered contact center prototype. This solution enables conversational interaction and multi-intent resolution through an automated voicebot and chat interface. It also incorporates a scalable service model to support growth, human transfer capabilities--when requested or for urgent cases--and an analytics pipeline for performance insights.

            In Spargine 8, I introduced the UlidGenerator type to make working with ULIDs easier in .NET applications. For the .NET 10 release, I took this idea further — converting ULIDs into a first-class value type (struct) in the DotNetTips.Spargine.Core assembly, similar in spirit to the built-in Guid type. Why? Because modern distributed applications increasingly need … Continue reading Boost Your .NET Projects with Spargine: High-Performance ULIDs with the Ulid Struct →

            When people think about tooling for Android development, the conversation often gravitates towards platform-specific concerns: UI performance, layout validation, device compatibility, or resource management. Yet for many Android teams, the most persistent challenges don’t sit at the platform level – they’re in the team’s Kotlin codebase itself. As Android projects scale, Kotlin brings strong language […]

            Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) goes beyond statistical metrics like perplexity or bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores. For most real-world generative AI scenarios, it’s crucial to understand whether a model is producing better outputs than a baseline or an earlier iteration. This is especially important for applications such as summarization, content generation, […]

We also cover how to request quota increases for your workload. By the end, you&#39;ll have a working implementation of global cross-Region inference in af-south-1.
