            In this post, we show you how to implement and evaluate three powerful techniques for tailoring FMs to your business needs: RAG, fine-tuning, and a hybrid approach combining both methods. We provid ready-to-use code to help you experiment with these approaches and make informed decisions based on your specific use case and dataset.

      <title>How Rufus doubled their inference speed and handled Prime Day traffic with AWS AI chips and parallel decoding</title>

            Rufus, an AI-powered shopping assistant, relies on many components to deliver its customer experience including a foundation LLM (for response generation) and a query planner (QP) model for query classification and retrieval enhancement. This post focuses on how the QP model used draft centric speculative decoding (SD)—also called parallel decoding—with AWS AI chips to meet the demands of Prime Day. By combining parallel decoding with AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, Rufus achieved two times faster response times, a 50% reduction in inference costs, and seamless scalability during peak traffic.

            Until now, Qodana linters have run exclusively in Docker containers. While this approach provided consistency and isolation, it also required significant effort for environment configuration, particularly for complex project setups or highly secured systems. Users have had to rely on the bootstrap mechanism to set up custom environments inside the Docker container, often duplicating the […]

            When debugging Java programs, developers are often under the impression that they’re interacting directly with the source code. This isn’t surprising – Java’s tooling does such an excellent job of hiding the complexity that it almost feels as if the source code exists at runtime. If you’re just starting with Java, you likely remember those […]

The compiler is not always smart enough to optimize every single ways. In this post, I will show you how to use pattern matching syntax to improve the performance of your code in some cases.

When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]

Since then, we have made several […]
