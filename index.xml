            Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is a common DevOps practice that enterprises use to provision and deploy IT infrastructure. Enterprises applying IaC and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines can maintain high availability and manage risk for their cloud environments at scale. However, multi-environment challenges, manual processes, and fragmented guidance still lead to configuration drift, errors, and inconsistencies. These issues are likely to result in downtime, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource utilization.

            I&#39;m excited to announce that &amp;quot;Sign in with Apple&amp;quot; is now generally available for external tenants in Entra External ID. The feature has been in public preview since February, and many customers have already integrated Apple as an identity provider for their applications.

            In .NET, many types provide a static Parse method to convert strings into their respective types. For example: int.Parse(&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;); double.Parse(&amp;quot;123.45&amp;quot;); DateTime.Parse(&amp;quot;2023-01-01&amp;quot;); IPAddress.Parse(&amp;quot;192.168.0.1&amp;quot;); However, enums require the use of the Enum.Parse method: Enum.Parse(&amp;quot;Value1&amp;quot;); // MyEnum.Parse(&amp;quot;Value1&amp;quot;); // This doesn&#39;t work Wouldn&#39;t it be more intuitive if enums supported a Parse…

            There’s a quiet rebellion happening in AI development. Developers are increasingly bypassing traditional planning and documentation processes in favor of a faster, more instinctive approach: “vibe coding.” It’s agile, it’s exciting, and in fast-moving teams, it often feels like the only way to keep pace. But when enterprise applications meet compliance-heavy environments, this seat-of-the-pants coding […] The article Hidden Security Risks of “Vibe Coding” for Enterprise AI Projects was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Network calls create significant performance bottlenecks in modern applications due to latency and unpredictability. Developers should prioritize chunky communication and batch requests to improve efficiency, as demonstrated through API development experiences. Monitoring usage and enforcing standards can enhance performance, emphasizing that optimal design must consider the entire stack, including network performance.

The client credentials flow is an OAuth 2.0 authorization grant type used for machine-to-machine authentication. DPoP further strengthens the security by ensuring that the client possesses a specific key at the time of the request, forcing […]
