            AWS provides a powerful set of tools and services that simplify the process of building and deploying generative AI applications, even for those with limited experience in frontend and backend development. In this post, we explore a practical solution that uses Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive data applications, and AWS services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Cognito, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create a user-friendly generative AI application with authentication and deployment.

             Introduction: Simplifying Caching with Aspect-Oriented Programming in .NET Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers elegant solutions for handling cross-cutting concerns in our .NET applications, such as method caching. In a previous article on GoatReview 🐐, we explored using Fody to implement a caching aspect. Although powerful, this tool presents significant challenges.

            Spargine is an open-source set of .NET 8 assemblies and NuGet packages created for efficient ULID generation, combining randomness with alphabetical sorting. ULIDs are compact, sortable identifiers offering uniqueness for distributed systems. The UlidGenerator class provides methods for generating ULIDs.

            When designing a software system, we naturally focus more on the happy flow. But we should carefully plan to handle errors that fall into three categories: Validation, Transient, and Fatal.

            Large Language Models (LLMs) operate with a defined limit on the number of tokens they can process at once, referred to as the context window. Exceeding this limit can have significant cost and performance implications. Therefore, it is essential to manage the size of the input sent to the LLM, particularly when using chat completion models. […]

            Clean Architecture&#39;s famous diagram is often misinterpreted as a project structure, leading developers to create artificial technical layers that scatter business logic across their codebase. Learn what the diagram really means and how to properly organize your code around business capabilities using components and clear boundaries.

            Amazon Bedrock has launched a capability that organizations can use to tag on-demand models and monitor associated costs. Organizations can now label all Amazon Bedrock models with AWS cost allocation tags, aligning usage to specific organizational taxonomies such as cost centers, business units, and applications.

            In this post, we discuss how to use AWS to support a decentralized clinical trial across the four main pillars of a decentralized clinical trial (virtual trials, personalized patient engagement, patient-centric trial design, and centralized data management). By exploring these AWS powered alternatives, we aim to demonstrate how organizations can drive progress towards more environmentally friendly clinical research practices.

            This blog shares insights on developing a GenAI gateway with multi-tenancy and quota management capabilities implemented using Azure APIM where customers can access the GenAI resources across different service tiers like Freemium, Basic, and Premium with each tier having it&#39;s own quota and rate limits. The solution used the concept of &amp;quot;Products&amp;quot; to group APIs related to specific entitlements and using Product Policies, simplifying the overall design and ensuring scalability.
