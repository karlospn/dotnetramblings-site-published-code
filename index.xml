            std::generator is a C++23 feature that enables you to write concise, straightforward functions that generate sequences of values on-demand without manually managing state. It builds upon C++20’s coroutines, providing some standard library support for this powerful, but complex, language feature. As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13, we ship an implementation of std::generator in our […]

            Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a […]

            This intelligent document processing solution uses Amazon Bedrock FMs to orchestrate a sophisticated workflow for handling multi-page healthcare documents with mixed content types. The solution uses the FM’s tool use capabilities, accessed through the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. This enables the FMs to not just process text, but to actively engage with various external tools and APIs to perform complex document analysis tasks.

            This post introduces a solution to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing a verified semantic cache using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, which checks if user questions match curated and verified responses before generating new answers. The solution combines the flexibility of LLMs with reliable, verified answers to improve response accuracy, reduce latency, and lower costs while preventing potential misinformation in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.

            In this post, we present the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework as a compound AI system implemented by the DSPy framework. The framework first generates a synthetic dataset from the domain knowledge base and documents for self-instruction, then drives model fine-tuning through SFT, and introduces the human-in-the-loop workflow to collect human and AI feedback to the model response, which is used to further improve the model performance by aligning human preference through reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF).

            本文翻译自Leslie Richardson的New Features for Enhanced Razor Productivity! 如果您现在正在使用 Razor 构建 Web 应用，我们为您带来了一些令人兴奋的新功能，无论您使用的是 Visual Studio 还是 Visual Studio Code，您都会爱上这些新功能！现在，您可以使用名为“将元素提取到新组件”的重构功能，以及全新的基于 Roslyn 的 C# 分词器，这些功能旨在提升您在 Razor 文件中的开发效率。让我们一起来看看吧！ 将元素提取到新组件 将元素提取到新组件是 Visual Studio 17.12 中提供的一项全新的重构功能，它可以自动化创建新 Razor/Blazor 组件的过程。您无需手动创建新文件并复制/粘贴代码，只需选中想要提取的代码（或标签），然后点击灯泡图标并选择将元素提取到新组件即可完成提取操作。该功能让创建可复用组件变得更加简单，有助于保持代码整洁，提高可维护性。 在该功能的首个版本中，提取为组件功能主要支持基础的、以 HTML 为主的代码提取场景。不过，我们计划在未来添加更多改进和支持更高级的场景（例如更一致地处理涉及变量依赖、C# 代码、参数等的提取）。 Roslyn C# 分词器 C# 分词器/词法分析器的更新显著提升了 Razor 对 C# 代码的处理能力。许多用户曾对无法在 Razor 文件中使用原始字符串文本和逐字插值字符串表示失望，而新的 Roslyn C# 词法分析器解决了这一问题！除了对这些字符串格式的支持外，词法分析器还增加了对二进制文本的支持，并改进了对 C# 预处理器指令的处理，确保它们遵循 C# 的规则。最后，新的词法分析器还将更容易支持未来的 C# […]

            In this post, we explore how you can use LLMs with advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate high-quality synthetic data for a finance domain use case. You can use the same technique for synthetic data for other business domain use cases as well. For this post, we demonstrate how to generate counterparty risk (CR) data, which would be beneficial for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are traded directly between two parties, without going through a formal exchange.

            The need to efficiently search and retrieve documents based on their semantic content is more important than ever—especially when building Generative AI systems that implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern. One robust approach to achieve this is by using vector representations of text data. These vectors, generated using advanced embedding models like Azure […] The article Enhanced In-Memory Text Vector Search in .NET with SharpVector and OpenAI Embeddings was originally published on Build5Nines.

            The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is a powerful tool for accelerating application deployment to Microsoft Azure. While azd defaults to Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment, you can configure it to work with HashiCorp Terraform too! This enables azd to be configured not just for Terraform deployments, but also to support cloud-agnostic IaC […] The article Configure Azure Developer CLI (azd) for HashiCorp Terraform Infrastructure Deployment was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Switching from BitConverter.ToString() to Convert.ToHexString() in .NET can significantly enhance performance and reduce memory usage for byte-to-hex conversions. This optimized method is faster and uses less memory, addressing best practices and CA1872 rule violations. For optimal results, consider updating your .editorConfig and exploring additional resources.

            In this post, we explain how F1 and AWS have developed a root cause analysis (RCA) assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock to reduce manual intervention and accelerate the resolution of recurrent operational issues during races from weeks to minutes. The RCA assistant enables the F1 team to spend more time on innovation and improving its services, ultimately delivering an exceptional experience for fans and partners. The successful collaboration between F1 and AWS showcases the transformative potential of generative AI in empowering teams to accomplish more in less time.

These AI models can process multiple content formats, including text, images, audio, and video. The users receive […]

            To better protect themselves, many cyclists are starting to ride with cameras mounted to the front or back of their bicycle. In this blog post, I will demonstrate a machine learning solution that cyclists can use to better identify close calls. The architecture of the solution uses Amazon Rekognition to detect vehicles in recorded bike ride videos. It then analyzes the video to determine if any vehicles are passing too close to the cyclist, within the 3-foot safe distance required by law.

            AI models are evolving fast, and DeepSeek-R1 is making waves as a serious competitor to OpenAI. But how well do these models understand Kotlin? Can they generate reliable code, explain tricky concepts, and help with debugging? JetBrains Research tested the latest AI models, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, and OpenAI o3-mini, using KotlinHumanEval and a new […]

            Database migrations are critical to modern application development and deployment, enabling teams to evolve their database schema alongside their application code. However, as systems grow in complexity and scale, managing migrations becomes increasingly challenging. At scale, a simple schema update can impact several microservices, terabytes of data, and global user traffic. It requires careful planning, […]

            In this article, we are going to learn about integrating Keycloak authentication in a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) frontend and a .NET Web API backend. With this setup, we will enable secure user authentication across both applications. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication, authorization, and user management out of the […] The post Keycloak Authentication With ASP.NET Core Web API and Blazor WebAssembly appeared first on Code Maze.

            This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per […]
