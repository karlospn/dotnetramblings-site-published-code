            Feature Flags are just conditional statements but can be much more powerful. Use them so you can integrate features before they are ready to be used in production. But they have a lot more utility than just being simple toggles. Here are different ways of thinking and using feature flags.

            In this blog post, we will show you how to implement tenant isolation using Amazon Bedrock agents within a multi-tenant environment. We’ll demonstrate this using a sample multi-tenant e-commerce application that provides a service for various tenants to create online stores. This application will use Amazon Bedrock agents to develop an AI assistant or chatbot capable of providing tenant-specific information, such as return policies and user-specific information like order counts and status updates.

            In this post, we show you how to use Amazon Bedrock to automate email responses to customer queries. With our solution, you can identify the intent of customer emails and send an automated response if the intent matches your existing knowledge base or data sources. If the intent doesn’t have a match, the email goes to the support team for a manual response.

            Semantic Kernel allows prompts to be automatically converted to ChatHistory instances. Developers can create prompts which include tags and these will be parsed (using an XML parser) and converted into instances of ChatMessageContent. See mapping of prompt syntax to completion service model for more information.

We use two data sources (websites) here. The first data source is an employee onboarding guide from a fictitious company, which requires basic authentication. We demonstrate how to set up authentication for the Web Crawler. The second data source is the official documentation for Amazon Q Business.

            Today, we are happy to announce the general availability of cross-region inference, a powerful feature allowing automatic cross-region inference routing for requests coming to Amazon Bedrock. This offers developers using on-demand inference mode, a seamless solution for managing optimal availability, performance, and resiliency while managing incoming traffic spikes of applications powered by Amazon Bedrock. By opting in, developers no longer have to spend time and effort predicting demand fluctuations.

            In this post, we discuss existing prompt-level threats and outline several security guardrails for mitigating prompt-level threats. For our example, we work with Anthropic Claude on Amazon Bedrock, implementing prompt templates that allow us to enforce guardrails against common security threats such as prompt injection. These templates are compatible with and can be modified for other LLMs.

            Through this series of posts, we share our generative AI journey and use cases, detailing the architecture, AWS services used, lessons learned, and the impact of these solutions on our teams and customers. In this first post, we explore Account Summaries, one of our initial production use cases built on Amazon Bedrock. Account Summaries equips our teams to be better prepared for customer engagements. It combines information from various sources into comprehensive, on-demand summaries available in our CRM or proactively delivered based on upcoming meetings.

            Managing dependencies is essential in modern application development. .NET provides a powerful Dependency Injection (DI) system, with ServiceCollection at its core. Typically, we register a service and use it as is. However, there are instances when we need to change the ServiceLifetime of services after registration. This article explores methods for changing ServiceLifeTime, providing practical […] The post Dynamically Change the ServiceLifetime of a Registered Service in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            When developing software, prioritize speed and cost, but consider the impact on meeting consumer needs. Leverage existing solutions like Microsoft .NET and third-party tools to avoid costly custom development. For enhanced productivity, explore UI frameworks and essential tools like CodeRush and GhostDoc in Visual Studio development. Embrace third-party products for better quality code, faster feature development, and cost savings.

            Amazon Q Business is a conversational assistant powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that enhances workforce productivity by answering questions and completing tasks based on information in your enterprise systems, which each user is authorized to access. In an earlier post, we discussed how you can build private and secure enterprise generative AI applications with Amazon Q Business and AWS IAM Identity Center. If you want to use Amazon Q Business to build enterprise generative AI applications, and have yet to adopt organization-wide use of AWS IAM Identity Center, you can use Amazon Q Business IAM Federation to directly manage user access to Amazon Q Business applications from your enterprise identity provider (IdP), such as Okta or Ping Identity.
