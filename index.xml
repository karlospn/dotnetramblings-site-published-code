      <title>Achieve ~2x speed-up in LLM inference with Medusa-1 on Amazon SageMaker AI</title>

            Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used.

            In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing.

            Did you know? The GC.KeepAlive() method in the .NET Framework is not used to prevent garbage collection of an object for the entire method scope, as you might think. Instead, it explicitly ensures that the object remains referenced at a specific point in the code after it’s last used. It’s particularly useful when dealing with […]

      <description>
        
          
            String concatenation in .NET can be optimized by using the Span type to enhance performance and reduce memory usage. By replacing traditional methods with AsSpan() and string.Concat(), memory allocations decrease significantly, yielding substantial performance gains. Adhering to best practices helps identify and rectify inefficient concatenation patterns.

            We are excited to announce that Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) 2.1 vision segmentation model is publicly available through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to deploy and run inference. Meta SAM 2.1 provides state-of-the-art video and image segmentation capabilities in a single model. In this post, we explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including Meta’s most advanced and capable models to date.

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can deploy an LLM such as DeepSeek-R1—or another FM of your choice—from popular model hubs like SageMaker JumpStart or Hugging Face Hub to SageMaker AI for real-time inference. We explore inference frameworks like Hugging Face TGI which helps streamline deployment while integrating built-in performance optimizations to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Additionally, we showcase how the SageMaker developer-friendly Python SDK simplifies endpoint orchestration, allowing seamless experimentation and scaling of LLM-powered applications.

            In this article, we’ll introduce hybrid caching in .NET, a new cache type that bridges the existing cache mechanisms in .NET: distributed cache and memory cache. We’ll start by briefly explaining a cache and how existing caches in .NET work. After that, we’ll explore hybrid caching and show how it can be used and configured […] The post Hybrid Caching in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

            The .NET ecosystem has gradually fused CQRS and MediatR together, creating a reflexive assumption that they&#39;re inseparable, but this mental shortcut has led teams down a path of unnecessary complexity. This article dispels common misconceptions by explaining how CQRS and MediatR are distinct tools solving different problems, and demonstrates how to implement CQRS effectively with or without MediatR.

            As technology continues to evolve, newer models are emerging, offering higher quality, increased flexibility, and faster image generation capabilities. One such groundbreaking model is Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), released by StabilityAI, advancing the text-to-image generative AI technology to unprecedented heights. In this post, we demonstrate how to efficiently fine-tune the SDXL model using SageMaker Studio. We show how to then prepare the fine-tuned model to run on AWS Inferentia2 powered Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances, unlocking superior price performance for your inference workloads.
