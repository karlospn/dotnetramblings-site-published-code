            In this post, we provide a step-by-step guide for creating an enterprise ready RAG application such as a question answering bot. We use the Llama3-8B FM for text generation and the BGE Large EN v1.5 text embedding model for generating embeddings from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.

            In this post, we dive into the best practices and techniques for prompting Meta Llama 3 using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to generate high-quality, relevant outputs. We discuss how to use system prompts and few-shot examples, and how to optimize inference parameters, so you can get the most out of Meta Llama 3.

            In this post, we discuss how generative artificial intelligence (AI) can help health insurance plan members get the information they need. The solution presented in this post not only enhances the member experience by providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, but also has the potential to reduce call volumes and operational costs for healthcare payers and plans.

            As generative AI moves from proofs of concept (POCs) to production, we’re seeing a massive shift in how businesses and consumers interact with data, information—and each other. In what we consider “Act 1” of the generative AI story, we saw previously unimaginable amounts of data and compute create models that showcase the power of generative […]

            In this post, we detail our collaboration in creating two proof of concept (PoC) exercises around multi-modal machine learning for survival analysis and cancer sub-typing, using genomic (gene expression, mutation and copy number variant data) and imaging (histopathology slides) data. We provide insights on interpretability, robustness, and best practices of architecting complex ML workflows on AWS with Amazon SageMaker. These multi-modal pipelines are being used on the Genomics England cancer cohort to enhance our understanding of cancer biomarkers and biology.

            In this article, let’s explore the various SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) accelerated numeric types in .NET. We’ll start by examining what SIMD stands for and how it works in .NET. Then, we’ll look at the different SIMD accelerated numeric types available in .NET. To conclude, we’ll implement a benchmark to compare the performance of […] The post SIMD Accelerated Numeric Types in C# appeared first on Code Maze.
