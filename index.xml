            In this post, we show how ML engineers familiar with Jupyter notebooks and SageMaker environments can efficiently work with DevOps engineers familiar with Kubernetes and related tools to design and maintain an ML pipeline with the right infrastructure for their organization. This enables DevOps engineers to manage all the steps of the ML lifecycle with the same set of tools and environment they are used to.

            In this post, we show you how Thomson Reuters Labs (TR Labs) was able to develop an efficient, flexible, and powerful MLOps process by adopting a standardized MLOps framework that uses AWS SageMaker, SageMaker Experiments, SageMaker Model Registry, and SageMaker Pipelines. The goal being to accelerate how quickly teams can experiment and innovate using AI and machine learning (ML)—whether using natural language processing (NLP), generative AI, or other techniques. We discuss how this has helped decrease the time to market for fresh ideas and helped build a cost-efficient machine learning lifecycle.

            The application of code rules is often conveyed as unidirectional and one-size-fits-all. In other words, when we learn to develop, we tend to read that there is only one way to produce quality code, and only one way to implement rules or patterns.With this series of articles, we aim

            When developing web applications using ASP.NET Core, we frequently encounter scenarios where we need to manage collections of strings. These collections can originate from various sources, such as HTTP headers, query strings, form data, and configuration settings. Efficiently handling these collections is crucial for maintaining the performance and scalability of our web applications. That’s where […] The post StringValues in ASP.NET Core appeared first on Code Maze.

            This post shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core application which uses OpenID Connect and OAuth PAR for authentication. The client application uses Keycloak as the identity provider. The Keycloak application is hosted in a docker container. The applications are run locally using .NET Aspire. This makes it really easy to develop using containers. Code: […]

            In this post, we explore a solution that uses the vector engine ChromaDB and Meta Llama 3, a publicly available foundation model hosted on SageMaker JumpStart, for a Text-to-SQL use case. We shared a brief history of Meta Llama 3, best practices for prompt engineering with Meta Llama 3 models, and an architecture pattern using few-shot prompting and RAG to extract the relevant schemas stored as vectors in ChromaDB.

            In this post, we provide insights and practical examples to help balance and optimize the prompt engineering workflow. We focus on advanced prompt techniques and best practices for the models provided in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API. With these prompting techniques, developers and researchers can harness the full capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, providing clear and concise communication while mitigating potential risks or undesirable outputs.

      <title>使用 MSTest.Analyzers 增强您的测试体验</title>

            本篇翻译于Jakub Jareš的Supercharge your testing experience with MSTest.Analyzers – .NET Blog (microsoft.com) MSTest 附带一组分析器，用于检查您的测试代码并指出常见的错误和陷阱。这些错误可能很微妙，并导致测试框架完全忽略您的测试。 我们从 3.2.0 版本就开始提供这些分析器了，但在最新的 3.5.1 版本中，我们添加了一些我们认为您不应错过的分析器。 遗漏的测试 一个常见问题是当您忘记在类上添加 [TestClass] 时。MSTest 将无法知道类中有测试，也不会运行它们： public class MyTests { [TestMethod] public async Task TestMethod1() { Assert.Fail(); } } 如果没有 MSTest.Analyzers，此代码在构建时不会出现警告或信息提示。运行测试时也不会出现测试失败的情况。由于类上没有 [TestClass] 属性，MSTest 会出于性能原因跳过整个类，并且您的测试将永远不会被找到。 但是使用分析器时您会在构建过程中收到一条信息提示： 我们建议将此信息提示升级为警告，甚至是构建错误。可以通过在 .editorconfig 文件中添加以下这行代码来实现 [*.cs] # MSTEST0030: Type containing &#39;[TestMethod]&#39; should be marked with &#39;[TestClass]&#39; dotnet_diagnostic.MSTEST0030.severity = warning 为什么默认情况下这不是警告？ 您可能会问为什么 MSTEST0030 默认是一条信息提示而不是默认的警告。原因是我们不能在 MSTest v3 中引入重大变更，而上述代码是一个常见的模式，用于从基类重用测试。 public class MyTestsBase { [TestMethod] public async Task CommonTestMethod() { } } [TestClass] public class MyTests : MyTestsBase { [TestMethod] public async Task TestMethod1() { Assert.

            The AWS DeepRacer League is the world’s first autonomous racing league, open to everyone and powered by machine learning (ML). AWS DeepRacer brings builders together from around the world, creating a community where you learn ML hands-on through friendly autonomous racing competitions. As we celebrate the achievements of over 560,000 participants from more than 150 countries who sharpened their skills through the AWS DeepRacer League over the last 6 years, we also prepare to close this chapter with a final season that serves as both a victory lap and a launching point for what’s next in the world of AWS DeepRacer.
