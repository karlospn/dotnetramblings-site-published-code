            Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid growth of semantic search applications. Semantic search understands both user intent and content context, rather than just matching keywords. LLMs enhance this capability through their advanced language processing abilities. These AI models can process multiple content formats, including text, images, audio, and video. The users receive […]

            To better protect themselves, many cyclists are starting to ride with cameras mounted to the front or back of their bicycle. In this blog post, I will demonstrate a machine learning solution that cyclists can use to better identify close calls. The architecture of the solution uses Amazon Rekognition to detect vehicles in recorded bike ride videos. It then analyzes the video to determine if any vehicles are passing too close to the cyclist, within the 3-foot safe distance required by law.

            AI models are evolving fast, and DeepSeek-R1 is making waves as a serious competitor to OpenAI. But how well do these models understand Kotlin? Can they generate reliable code, explain tricky concepts, and help with debugging? JetBrains Research tested the latest AI models, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, and OpenAI o3-mini, using KotlinHumanEval and a new […]

            Database migrations are critical to modern application development and deployment, enabling teams to evolve their database schema alongside their application code. However, as systems grow in complexity and scale, managing migrations becomes increasingly challenging. At scale, a simple schema update can impact several microservices, terabytes of data, and global user traffic. It requires careful planning, […]

            While offset pagination is widely used, cursor-based pagination offers significant performance advantages - my tests show a 17x speedup when paginating through a million-record dataset in PostgreSQL. Let&#39;s take a deep dive into cursor pagination, compare it with offset pagination, and examine the SQL execution plans.

            本文翻译自 Máňa, Natalia 和 Anton 创作的 .NET 9 Networking Improvements 秉承我们的传统，我们很高兴与您分享这篇博客文章，以介绍新的 .NET 版本中网络领域相关的最新动态和最有趣的变化。今年，我们带来了 HTTP 领域的改变、新的 HttpClientFactory API、.NET Framework 兼容性优化等更多内容。 HTTP 在接下来的部分中，我们将介绍 HTTP 领域最具影响力的变化。其中包括连接池的性能优化、对多个HTTP/3连接的支持、Windows代理的自动更新，以及重要的社区贡献。 连接池 在此版本中，我们对HTTP连接池进行了两项显著的性能优化。 我们增加了对多个HTTP/3连接的可选支持。根据RFC 9114标准文档，由于连接可以多路复用并行请求，因此不鼓励使用多个HTTP/3连接到对等端。然而，在某些场景下，例如服务器到服务器的通信，即使请求多路复用，单一连接也可能成为瓶颈。我们在 HTTP/2 中看到了这样的限制（dotnet/runtime#35088），它同样具有在单一连接上多路复用的概念。出于同样的原因（dotnet/runtime#51775），我们决定为HTTP/3实现多连接支持（dotnet/runtime#101535）。 该实现本身尽可能贴近 HTTP/2 多连接机制的行为。当前，它的策略是优先填充已有连接，直到达到对端允许的请求上限后，才会创建新的连接。不过，需要注意的是，这是一个具体的实现细节，该行为在未来可能会有所变化。 结果是，我们的基准测试显示每秒请求数（RPS）有显著提升，以下是10,000个并行请求的对比结果： 客户端 单 HTTP/3 连接 多 HTTP/3 连接 最大CPU使用率(%) 35 92 最大核心使用率(%) 971 2572 最大工作集(MB) 3810 6491 最大私有内存(MB) 4415 7228 处理器数量 28 28 […]

            Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used.

            In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing.

            Did you know? The GC.KeepAlive() method in the .NET Framework is not used to prevent garbage collection of an object for the entire method scope, as you might think. Instead, it explicitly ensures that the object remains referenced at a specific point in the code after it’s last used. It’s particularly useful when dealing with […]

      <description>
        
          
            String concatenation in .NET can be optimized by using the Span type to enhance performance and reduce memory usage. By replacing traditional methods with AsSpan() and string.Concat(), memory allocations decrease significantly, yielding substantial performance gains. Adhering to best practices helps identify and rectify inefficient concatenation patterns.

            In this post, we demonstrate how to build a knowledge base solution by integrating enterprise data with Amazon Q Business using Amazon S3. This approach helps organizations improve operational efficiency, reduce response times, and gain valuable insights from their historical data. The solution uses AWS security best practices to promote data protection while enabling teams to create a comprehensive knowledge base from various data sources.

            GraphStorm is a low-code enterprise graph machine learning (ML) framework that provides ML practitioners a simple way of building, training, and deploying graph ML solutions on industry-scale graph data. In this post, we demonstrate how GraphBolt enhances GraphStorm’s performance in distributed settings. We provide a hands-on example of using GraphStorm with GraphBolt on SageMaker for distributed training. Lastly, we share how to use Amazon SageMaker Pipelines with GraphStorm.

            Working on event-driven applications can be challenging, where you need to write a large number of methods. Remembering those methods and deciding their usage for every requirement is tedious, especially when methods have different signatures. C# brings delegates to cope with this problem. Delegating is a powerful feature introduced solely
