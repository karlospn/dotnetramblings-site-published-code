            We are excited to announce the public preview of support for inline code nodes in Amazon Bedrock Flows. With this powerful new capability, you can write Python scripts directly within your workflow, alleviating the need for separate AWS Lambda functions for simple logic. This feature streamlines preprocessing and postprocessing tasks (like data normalization and response formatting), simplifying generative AI application development and making it more accessible across organizations.

            The market for pre-hardened container images is experiencing explosive growth as security-conscious organizations pursue the ultimate efficiency: instant security with minimal operational overhead. The value proposition is undeniably compelling—hardened images with minimal dependencies promise security &amp;quot;out of the box,&amp;quot; enabling teams to focus on building and shipping applications rather than constantly revisiting low-level configuration management....

            Slow APIs hurt users&#39; experience and the owners&#39; pocket. Users become disappointed, and the server costs more if APIs are not up to standard in large projects. I also faced a similar issue in my project. However, I cut down the performance overhead marginally. This article breaks down

            In this post, we explore how to enable and use trusted identity propagation in Amazon SageMaker Studio, which allows organizations to simplify access management by granting permissions to existing AWS IAM Identity Center identities. The solution demonstrates how to implement fine-grained access controls based on a physical user&#39;s identity, maintain detailed audit logs across supported AWS services, and support long-running user background sessions for training jobs.

This solution excels in handling multimodal data sources, seamlessly processing text, diagrams, and numerical data while maintaining context and relationships between different data elements. In this post, we provide insights on the solution and walk you through different approaches and architecture patterns explored, like different chunking, multi-vector retrieval, and hybrid search during the development.

            In this post, we demonstrate the implementation of a practical RAG chat-based assistant using a comprehensive stack of modern technologies. The solution uses NVIDIA NIMs for both LLM inference and text embedding services, with the NIM Operator handling their deployment and management. The architecture incorporates Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings for similarity search.
