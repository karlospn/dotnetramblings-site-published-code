            Today, we are excited to announce that Pixtral 12B (pixtral-12b-2409), a state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) from Mistral AI that excels in both text-only and multimodal tasks, is available for customers through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. You can try this model with SageMaker JumpStart, a machine learning (ML) hub that provides access to algorithms and models that can be deployed with one click for running inference. In this post, we walk through how to discover, deploy, and use the Pixtral 12B model for a variety of real-world vision use cases.

            Introduction In modern distributed .NET applications, managing context across execution boundaries is a critical architectural concern. While both AsyncLocal and ThreadLocal provide mechanisms for maintaining contextual data, their implementations and use cases differ significantly in ways that impact system architecture, performance, and maintainability.

            Introduction Some years ago, we were wrestling with a persistent issue in our data stack. Every team had their own way of collecting and structuring data. What was a simple query for one team became a debugging nightmare for another. Discovering the right dataset felt like looking for a needle in a haystack, and standardizing […]

            AI-powered code assistant tools like GitHub Copilot have revolutionized the development landscape. We’ve observed significant Copilot adoption among Global System Integrators (GSIs), who are leading the charge in harnessing its potential. While many developers are already utilizing GitHub Copilot in their internal projects, GSI’s are eager to integrate Copilot into their own application development lifecycles. […]

            Understanding where a dependency comes from can be tedious. This is especially true when you have a large project with many dependencies. Recently, .NET brings a new tool dotnet nuget why to help you understand why a package is installed in your project. However, there is a better way to do it, and it doesn&#39;t requires a recent SDK. dotnet nuget why can explain why a package is included in your project:…

            In this post, we demonstrate how you can use Amazon SageMaker HyperPod training plans, to bring down your training cluster procurement wait time. We guide you through a step-by-step implementation on how you can use the (AWS CLI) or the AWS Management Console to find, review, and create optimal training plans for your specific compute and timeline needs. We further guide you through using the training plan to submit SageMaker training jobs or create SageMaker HyperPod clusters.

Users can combine SageMaker JumpStart&#39;s model hosting with Bedrock&#39;s security and monitoring tools. We demonstrate this using the Gemma 2 9B Instruct model as an example, showing how to deploy it and use Bedrock&#39;s advanced capabilities.
