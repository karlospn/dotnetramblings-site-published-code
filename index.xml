            In this post, we show how climate tech startups are developing foundation models (FMs) that use extensive environmental datasets to tackle issues such as carbon capture, carbon-negative fuels, new materials design for microplastics destruction, and ecosystem preservation. These specialized models require advanced computational capabilities to process and analyze vast amounts of data effectively.

            In this post, we&#39;ll explore how to combine Amazon Bedrock prompt caching with Claude Code—a coding agent released by Anthropic that is now generally available. This powerful combination transforms your development workflow by delivering lightning-fast responses from reducing inference response latency, as well as lowering input token costs.

            Every day, developers tackle complex workflows involving planning, coding, reviewing, testing, securing, and releasing software. These tasks, often scattered across various tools and platforms, create friction that slows us down. At Microsoft, we believe AI can change that. This belief led us to create Athena, an AI-powered collaborative ag

Before Microsoft officially named it “.NET,” the platform was internally referred to as NGWS: Next Generation Windows Services. The name “.NET” was adopted in the late 1990s to emphasize the platform’s focus on web-based development and interoperability, as opposed to being […]

            Introduction Junie is an intelligent coding agent developed by JetBrains. It automates the full development loop: reading project files, editing code, running tests, and applying fixes, going far beyond simple code generation. Similar to how developers use tools like ChatGPT to solve coding problems, Junie takes it a step further by automating the entire process. […]

            In this post, we explore how to use Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build intelligent applications. Unlike traditional vector search, which retrieves documents based on similarity scores, knowledge graphs encode relationships between entities, allowing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve information with context-aware reasoning.

            When a regulatory body like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduces changes to regulations, organizations are required to evaluate the changes against their internal SOPs. When necessary, they must update their SOPs to align with the regulation changes and maintain compliance. In this post, we show different approaches using Amazon Bedrock to identify relationships between regulation changes and SOPs.

            The author reflects on two decades of speaking engagements, emphasizing the importance of soft skills in software engineering over mere technical knowledge. They argue that communication, empathy, and collaboration are crucial for career growth. While major conferences often overlook these topics, community-driven events showcase their value, urging attendees to advocate for more sessions on soft skills.

            ASP.NET Core provides great extension points for handling OpenID Connect error events. This blog looks at implementing error handling in an ASP.NET Core application implemented using ASP.NET Core Identity. Code: https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityExternalErrorHandling Setup The application uses OpenID Connect to implement the authentication of the user identities. This implements a standard OpenID Connect flow and uses Microsoft […]

            ZURU collaborated with AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and AWS Professional Services to implement a more accurate text-to-floor plan generator using generative AI. In this post, we show you why a solution using a large language model (LLM) was chosen. We explore how model selection, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be used to improve results.

            Non-conversational applications offer unique advantages such as higher latency tolerance, batch processing, and caching, but their autonomous nature requires stronger guardrails and exhaustive quality assurance compared to conversational applications, which benefit from real-time user feedback and supervision. This post examines four diverse Amazon.com examples of such generative AI applications.

            OpenSearch offers a wide range of third-party machine learning (ML) connectors to support this augmentation. This post highlights two of these third-party ML connectors. The first connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Comprehend connector. In this post, we show you how to use this connector to invoke the LangDetect API to detect the languages of ingested documents. The second connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Bedrock connector to invoke the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2 model so that you can create embeddings from ingested documents and perform semantic search.

            In this post, we demonstrate an example of building an agentic RAG application using the LlamaIndex framework. LlamaIndex is a framework that connects FMs with external data sources. It helps ingest, structure, and retrieve information from databases, APIs, PDFs, and more, enabling the agent and RAG for AI applications. This application serves as a research tool, using the Mistral Large 2 FM on Amazon Bedrock generate responses for the agent flow.

            Rufus, an AI-powered shopping assistant, relies on many components to deliver its customer experience including a foundation LLM (for response generation) and a query planner (QP) model for query classification and retrieval enhancement. This post focuses on how the QP model used draft centric speculative decoding (SD)—also called parallel decoding—with AWS AI chips to meet the demands of Prime Day. By combining parallel decoding with AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, Rufus achieved two times faster response times, a 50% reduction in inference costs, and seamless scalability during peak traffic.

            The article emphasizes the critical importance of data validation in software engineering. It highlights Spargine&#39;s Validator class, which offers various methods for ensuring data integrity, such as checking for null values, file existence, and enum validity. By adopting these techniques, developers can improve code safety and maintainability.
