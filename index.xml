            There are times when it’s necessary to download the text transcript of a YouTube video using Python. This can be done with the help of the youtube_transcript_api library. Getting access to the text content of YouTube videos can be extremely helpful when using Generative AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create summarization, analysis, or […] The article Python: Get YouTube Video Transcript from URL for use in Generative AI and RAG Summarization was originally published on Build5Nines.

The next application you launch does the same […]

            To add fine-grained control to how tools are used, we have released a feature for tool choice for Amazon Nova models. Instead of relying on prompt engineering, tool choice forces the model to adhere to the settings in place. In this post, we discuss tool use and the new tool choice feature, with example use cases.

            Today, we’re announcing a significant enhancement to Amazon Bedrock Guardrails: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy-based enforcement. This powerful capability enables security and compliance teams to establish mandatory guardrails for every model inference call, making sure organizational safety policies are consistently enforced across AI interactions. This feature enhances AI governance by enabling centralized control over guardrail implementation.

            Slow build times are a major headache for developers, especially in large, complex C++ codebases like game engines. Every minute spent waiting on a build is time that could be used to refine features, resolve issues, or push development forward. Activision faced this challenge with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, where prolonged build times […]

            Healthcare decisions often require integrating information from multiple sources, such as medical literature, clinical databases, and patient records. LLMs lack the ability to seamlessly access and synthesize data from these diverse and distributed sources. This limits their potential to provide comprehensive and well-informed insights for healthcare applications. In this blog post, we will explore how Mistral LLM on Amazon Bedrock can address these challenges and enable the development of intelligent healthcare agents with LLM function calling capabilities, while maintaining robust data security and privacy through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

            The integration of generative AI agents into business processes is poised to accelerate as organizations recognize the untapped potential of these technologies. Advancements in multimodal artificial intelligence (AI), where agents can understand and generate not just text but also images, audio, and video, will further broaden their applications. This post will discuss agentic AI driven architecture and ways of implementing.

            Azure Storage Accounts are a fundamental part of cloud storage in Microsoft Azure, providing various types of storage services such as blobs, files, tables, and queues. Understanding the total size allocated to a storage account and the usage breakdown per service type is crucial for optimizing costs, managing capacity, and ensuring efficient data storage management. […] The article Get Total Size Allocated to Azure Storage Account (Blobs, Files, Tables and Queues) was originally published on Build5Nines.

      <title>Microsoft .NET Code Analysis: When CountAsync() Outperforms AnyAsync() in .NET</title>

            The article critiques code analysis rule CA1828 in Microsoft .NET, which suggests using AnyAsync() over CountAsync() for checking item existence in IQueryable collections. Benchmark results indicate CountAsync() outperforms both AnyAsync() and LongCountAsync(), pointing to potential inefficiencies in following CA1828. The author recommends adjusting rule severity to optimize performance.
