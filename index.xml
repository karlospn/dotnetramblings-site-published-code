            Enterprises in regulated industries often need mathematical certainty that every AI response complies with established policies and domain knowledge. Regulated industries can’t use traditional quality assurance methods that test only a statistical sample of AI outputs and make probabilistic assertions about compliance. When we launched Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in preview at […]

            The English idiom turn into a pumpkin comes from the fairy tale story of Cinderella, in which the protagonist&#39;s ragged clothes are magically transformed into an elegant gown and a pumpkin is transformed into a carriage, allowing her to attend a royal ball.

No cloud platform is immune to failures — from regional outages and transient network blips to human errors or hardware faults.

            If you’ve ever tried to track down a bug in concurrent programs, you know how chaotic and frustrating it can be: everything seems to work fine, then suddenly crashes, and you can’t quite pin down why – all while the bugs slip through. To bring order to this chaos, at JetBrains Research we built LitmusKt […]

            gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b are two open-weight reasoning models post-trained from the gpt-oss models and trained to reason from a provided policy in order to label content under that policy. In this report, we describe gpt-oss-safeguard’s capabilities and provide our baseline safety evaluations on the gpt-oss-safeguard models, using the underlying gpt-oss models as a baseline. For more information about the development and architecture of the underlying gpt-oss models, see the original gpt-oss model model card⁠.

            Defensive programming emphasizes anticipating potential failures in code, treating every line as a possible error point. Developers should use structured exception handling, provide meaningful error messages, and maintain system integrity. Tools like Spargine facilitate effective defensive programming by simplifying error handling and promoting resilience in applications by addressing unexpected scenarios.
