            I had earlier said that “full” support for .NET Aspire would be a key part of the Wolverine 3.0 plans. After kicking the tires more on .NET Aspire and seeing where user priorities and our own road map is, I’m going to back off that statement quite a bit. Here’s what’s definitely in and actually … Continue reading Update on Wolverine 3.0 and Aspire →

These patterns are often used interchangeably, and while they are very similar, there are some key differences that we will highlight. First, let’s talk about the two architectures.

I explored how Bedrock enables customers to build a secure, compliant foundation for generative AI applications. Now I’d like to turn to a slightly more technical, but equally important differentiator for Bedrock—the multiple techniques that you can use to customize models and meet your specific business needs.

            Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art approach to building question answering systems that combines the strengths of retrieval and foundation models (FMs). RAG models first retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of text and then use a FM to synthesize an answer based on the retrieved information. An end-to-end RAG solution involves several […]

            In this post, we demonstrate the process of fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B on SageMaker to specialize it in the generation of SQL queries (text-to-SQL). Meta Llama 3 8B is a relatively small model that offers a balance between performance and resource efficiency. AWS customers have explored fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B for the generation of SQL queries—especially when using non-standard SQL dialects—and have requested methods to import their customized models into Amazon Bedrock to benefit from the managed infrastructure and security that Amazon Bedrock provides when serving those models.

            In today’s data-driven world, finding similar items within large datasets is a common challenge. Whether it’s recommending products, identifying similar documents, or clustering data points, efficient similarity search is crucial. This blog post will explore how to leverage FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and Azure SQL to perform similarity searches on Wikipedia movie plots data.

            Did you know? In 1936, Russian engineer Vladimir Lukyanov built a mechanical computer known as a Water Integrator that carefully manipulated water in a room full of interconnected pipes and pumps. The water level in various chambers represented stored numbers, and the computer could solve complex mathematical equations. I’m sure the last thing Vladimir wanted […]

            大家好，欢迎来到 Visual Studio Code 7月份的 Java 更新！本博客将覆盖最新的 Gradle 功能增强、用户体验改进以及新的 Spring 功能，让我们开始吧！ Gradle 功能增强 支持 Gradle 的 HCR （热代码替换） HCR（热代码替换）是 VS Code Java 调试器支持的一项高级功能。它允许您启动调试会话并更改 Java 文件而无需重启，调试器将在运行中的 JVM 中替换代码。以前，这项功能不支持 Gradle 插件中使用的 Gradle 构建服务器。在我们最近的更新中，我们已经实现了这一支持，现在您可以在调试会话中利用 HCR。这里有一个此功能的演示。 要了解有关 HCR 的更多详情，请访问此链接。 委托测试到 Gradle 在我们的最新插件发布中，我们增加了“Delegate Test to Gradle”的支持，这允许您在 VS Code Java 中执行测试中委托Gradle进行测试，确保结果与命令行工具保持一致，并利用 Gradle 工具中的优势。要使用此功能，只需在运行测试之前选择“Delegate Test to Gradle”作为默认测试配置文件。这里有一个如何使用它的演示。 在这次发布中，我们只支持“运行测试”，但我们也计划很快支持“调试测试”，所以请继续关注。下面是这个功能的演示。 要使用上述 Gradle 功能，请安装 Extension Pack for Java 和 Gradle for Java插件。 用户体验改进 在文件管理器中创建 Java 包 创建 Java 包是 Java 开发人员经常执行的任务，根据用户反馈，我们已将此操作添加到文件管理器的右键菜单中。要访问它，用户只需在文件管理器中右键单击一个文件夹，并在那里找到“Create Java Package”以及其他常见的 Java 任务。以下是参考的屏幕截图。 从状态栏访问帮助中心(Help Center) 我们为 Java 开发人员创建了一个帮助中心，这个帮助中心提供了各种有用信息和文档，方便Java开发者快速上手和学习关于VS Code Java的使用方法。以前，它有些隐藏并不容易访问。在最新发布中，我们通过在状态栏中添加了它的快捷方式，让它更方便访问。这是如何从状态栏访问帮助中心的演示。 Spring 功能更新 我们还有几个令人兴奋的新 Spring 功能。要使用以下功能，请安装 Spring Boot 插件包。 SpEL 语法高亮显示和验证 像 JPQL 语法高亮显示一样，SpEL 表达式现在在注解（如 @Value）或查询中也具有语法高亮显示和基本验证。 Spring 注解的内容辅助和查找引用支持 每个版本迭代后，使用 Java 源代码中的 Spring 注解都变得更快更容易。最新的 Spring Boot 工具增加了对以下内容的高级支持： @Profile（自动完成和查找配置文件名的引用） @Qualifier（自动完成，转到定义和查找限定符值的引用） @DependsOn（自动完成，转到定义的 bean 名称） @Resource（自动完成和转到定义的 bean 名称） @Value（自动完成和转到定义的类路径资源） 这里有内容辅助和查找引用的演示。 内容辅助 查找引用 安装 Java 插件包 要使用上述所有功能，请在 Visual Studio Code 上下载并安装Extension Pack for Java 。 如果您是一位Spring开发者，并且正在编写Spring Boot相关的程序，您也可以下载并安装Spring Boot插件包，获得与Spring Boot有关的专属开发体验 反馈与建议 2024 年，Visual Studio Code 上的 Java 会有很多激动人心的更新，一如既往，您的反馈和建议对我们非常重要，将有助于我们未来的产品塑造。有几种方法可以给我们留下反馈 填写中文问卷 在这个帖子下留言 在我们的GitHub repo上创建Issue 发送电子邮件到vscjfeedback@microsoft.
