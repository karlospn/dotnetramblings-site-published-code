            Certain versions of Docker Engine have a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low. This advisory outlines the issue, identifies the affected versions, and provides remediation steps for impacted users.

            Hello, everyone! AI planning is a powerful tool that allows to generate and execute complex workflows in applications based on specified goal. In Semantic Kernel, it’s possible to implement planning logic using FunctionCallingStepwisePlanner class. Today we want to introduce a new way how to achieve the same results by using Automatic Function Calling.

            Since the very earlier days of Semantic Kernel, we have shipped experimental “planners” that use prompts to generate multi-step plans. This was extremely powerful because it allowed developers to use LLMs (which were created to merely generate text) to begin automating business processes.

            Today, we are excited to announce AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia support for fine-tuning and inference of the Llama 3.1 models. The Llama 3.1 family of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pre-trained and instruction tuned generative models in 8B, 70B, and 405B sizes. In a previous post, we covered how to deploy Llama 3 models on AWS Trainium and Inferentia based instances in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. In this post, we outline how to get started with fine-tuning and deploying the Llama 3.

            GitHub Copilot code completions are autocomplete-stye suggestions that appear inline as you code. Until today, they have used context from your active file and other tabs open in the editor to inform the suggestion that is returned. However, we know that more contextually relevant input leads to better suggestions.

            By default, PowerShell doesn&#39;t stop the script when an error occurs. Instead, it writes the error to the error stream and continues executing the script. You can change this behavior by setting the $ErrorActionPreference variable to Stop. When you do this, PowerShell stops the script when an error occurs. PowerShell has two different kinds of commands: cmdlets and native commands. For example,…
