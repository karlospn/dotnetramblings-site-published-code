            This post explores how you can use Amazon S3-based templates to simplify ModelOps workflows, walk through the key benefits compared to using Service Catalog approaches, and demonstrates how to create a custom ModelOps solution that integrates with GitHub and GitHub Actions—giving your team one-click provisioning of a fully functional ML environment.

            In this post, we walk through how global cross-Region inference routes requests and where your data resides, then show you how to configure the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions and invoke Claude 4.5 models using the global inference profile Amazon Resource Name (ARN). We also cover how to request quota increases for your workload. By the end, you&#39;ll have a working implementation of global cross-Region inference in af-south-1.

            As enterprise customers roll out and govern AI agents through Agent 365, they have been asking for pre canned evals they can run out of the box. They want transparent, reproducible evaluations that reflect their own work in realistic environments, including interoperability, how agents con

            In this post, we discuss how to use AppSync Events as the foundation of a capable, serverless, AI gateway architecture. We explore how it integrates with AWS services for comprehensive coverage of the capabilities offered in AI gateway architectures. Finally, we get you started on your journey with sample code you can launch in your account and begin building.

It scores 0.58 on SWE-bench Verified. We tried Claude Sonnet 4.5 next, which scored 0.6 and ran faster on most tasks. But complex problems hit Claude’s 200K […]

            Amazon Bedrock AgentCore services are now being supported by various IaC frameworks such as AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), Terraform and AWS CloudFormation Templates. This integration brings the power of IaC directly to AgentCore so developers can provision, configure, and manage their AI agent infrastructure. In this post, we use CloudFormation templates to build an end-to-end application for a weather activity planner.
