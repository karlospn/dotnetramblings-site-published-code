            AWS announced managed tiered checkpointing in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a purpose-built infrastructure to scale and accelerate generative AI model development across thousands of AI accelerators. Managed tiered checkpointing uses CPU memory for high-performance checkpoint storage with automatic data replication across adjacent compute nodes for enhanced reliability. In this post, we dive deep into those concepts and understand how to use the managed tiered checkpointing feature.

            When working with byte arrays in performance-critical applications, every nanosecond and allocation counts. Fortunately, in .NET, there is a class that provides several high-performance methods that can significantly improve speed and reduce memory overhead when converting and manipulating arrays.

            This post explores the Real-Time Race Track (RTRT), an interactive experience built using Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock, that lets fans design, customize, and share their own racing circuits. We highlight how generative AI capabilities come together to deliver strategic racing insights such as pit timing and tire choices, and interactive features like an AI voice assistant and a retro-style racing poster.

You might have product details owned by the catalog service, pricing owned by sales, reviews owned by a reviews service, shipping information somewhere else, and order counts somewhere else.

            Running large AI models in the cloud gives access to immense capabilities, but it doesn’t come for free. The bigger the models, the bigger the bills, and with them, the risk of unexpected costs. Local models flip the equation. They safeguard privacy and keep costs predictable, but their smaller size often limits what you can...

            Many developers have run into subtle issues with annotations when working with Kotlin and frameworks like Spring or JPA-based persistence frameworks. For instance, an annotation applied to a constructor parameter might not always end up in the property or backing field where the framework expects it. This often means annotations don’t land where they’re needed. […]

            MCP is not an API. Tools are not agents. MCP is more than tools. Here’s what this means in practice. Most developers misread the Model Context Protocol because they map it onto familiar API mental models. That mistake breaks agent designs, observability, and the “last mile” where non-deterministic reasoning must meet deterministic execution. This piece...

            In this post, we demonstrate how to use the new Amazon SageMaker HyperPod CLI and SDK to streamline the process of training and deploying large AI models through practical examples of distributed training using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) and model deployment for inference. The tools provide simplified workflows through straightforward commands for common tasks, while offering flexible development options through the SDK for more complex requirements, along with comprehensive observability features and production-ready deployment capabilities.
