            The post emphasizes the importance of delivering effective technical presentations through engaging demos that reflect real-world scenarios. It suggests pre-recording demos to avoid failures caused by unreliable internet connections and stresses the significance of audience engagement over screen focus. Accessibility is highlighted through light mode and larger fonts for better visibility.

            I’ve built a number of online stores over the years and one thing remains true… Customers get pretty annoyed if you charge them twice for the same thing. So how can you avoid such calamity? Well you probably want to architect your backend to reduce the chances of an operation being called twice. For example you might use a session id and block an order from being created/placed if another one has already been created for that session id.

            Introduction When interacting with a large language model (LLM), its knowledge comes from data used during its training, which is often mostly from public sources. As a result, the model’s knowledge may not fully reflect the most current information. This leads to three main issues: outdated information, no access to internal company data, and potential […]

            Code completion has always been a standout feature in JetBrains IDEs, helping developers code faster, smarter, and with fewer mistakes. But what if it could do even more? What if it could predict not just the next element but entire lines of code – or even complete blocks? That’s exactly what we’ve been working on. […]

            For nearly twenty years, the .NET community has enjoyed working with solution files (*.sln). Due to their tooling-centered format, manually changing these files has always been challenging. Merge conflicts in solution files—much like merging CSPROJ files—were commonplace and often resulted in corrupted files or lost changes. The structure of SLN files is overly verbose—an empty […]
