            In today’s fast-paced world of software development, product teams are expected to move quickly: building features, shipping updates, and reacting to user needs in real-time. But moving fast should never mean compromising on quality or security. Thanks to modern tooling, developers can now maintain high standards while accelerating delivery. In a previous article, we explored...

            Visual Studio power users love ReSharper’s deep analysis, but the cost has been the occasional UI hiccup that breaks the flow of work. In ReSharper 2025.2, analysis runs in a separate 64-bit worker out of Visual Studio’s UI process. Previously, ReSharper shared Visual Studio’s UI process, so long analyses could stall the UI thread. Now, […]

            This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev. Developing and releasing iOS applications involves navigating a complex web of code signing, provisioning profiles, multiple iOS versions, and stringent App Store guidelines/requirements. Without an automated continuous integration, continuous delivery and/or deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, these challenges can lead to slower release cycles, increased errors, and […]

            The tracking pointer designs we&#39;ve been using so far have had O(n) complexity on move, where n is the number of outstanding tracking pointers. But we can reduce this to O(1) by the classic technique of introducing another level of indirection. What we can do is give every trackable object

            Git worktree is a powerful feature that allows you to have multiple working directories associated with a single repository. Instead of switching branches and potentially losing uncommitted work, you can check out different branches in separate directories simultaneously without recloning the repository. Git worktree creates additional working trees linked to the same repository. Each worktree can have a…

            The Spargine library introduces ChannelQueue, an efficient, thread-safe queue for .NET asynchronous programming, addressing the lack of a built-in async queue. It supports various features like async operations, bounded capacities, cancellation, and batch processing, making it ideal for managing async data flows and enhancing application responsiveness.

            Not all abstractions are created equal. Some isolate real volatility and protect your system from change. Others quietly pile up complexity and hide performance problems. Learn when to embrace abstractions versus when they become technical debt that slows down your team.

            In this post, we introduce our open source GenAI IDP Accelerator—a tested solution that we use to help customers across industries address their document processing challenges. Automated document processing workflows accurately extract structured information from documents, reducing manual effort. We will show you how this ready-to-deploy solution can help you build those workflows with generative AI on AWS in days instead of months.

            In this post, we introduced three features in SageMaker HyperPod that enhance scalability and customizability for ML infrastructure. Continuous provisioning offers flexible resource provisioning to help you start training and deploying your models faster and manage your cluster more efficiently. With custom AMIs, you can align your ML environments with organizational security standards and software requirements.
