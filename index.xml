            In this post, we demonstrate how to orchestrate multiple Amazon Bedrock agents to create a sophisticated Amazon EKS troubleshooting system. By enabling collaboration between specialized agents—deriving insights from K8sGPT and performing actions through the ArgoCD framework—you can build a comprehensive automation that identifies, analyzes, and resolves cluster issues with minimal human intervention.

            There’s been a noticeable pushback against microservices lately, and we’re seeing a strong swing back toward monoliths. But I have to ask, if you can’t build a solid microservices system, what makes you think you can build a good monolith?

            In this post, we explore how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be used to address these challenges effectively. Specifically, we discuss using LoRA serving with LoRA eXchange (LoRAX) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) GPU instances, allowing organizations to efficiently manage and serve their growing portfolio of fine-tuned models, optimize costs, and provide seamless performance for their customers.

            I posted recently about how to allow LLMs to call tools using the Microsoft.Extensions.AI NuGet package in C#. Obviously, a common usage scenario would be to expose MCP servers as tools for your LLM to call. Thankfully, the new ModelContextProtocol NuGet package makes this straightforward. Note: This package is still in pre-release (as is Microsoft.Extensions.AI), so do check the release notes for any breaking changes to the API. I&#39;ve updated my demo application to support calling MCP tools, following the techniques demonstrated in Microsoft&#39;s Chat With Tools sample.

            In .NET, string comparison can be performed using methods like ==, Equals(), and Compare(), each with distinct performance metrics. The most efficient method is Equals() with StringComparison. It&#39;s crucial to apply optimization practices for enhanced performance, especially in multilingual comparisons, and consider utilizing configuration files for consistent analysis.

We showcase how to build an AIOps chatbot that enables users to interact with their AWS infrastructure through natural language queries and commands. The chatbot is capable of handling tasks such as querying the data about Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) ports and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets access settings.

            GitHub Copilot is continuing to evolve very rapidly, with the recent launch of &amp;quot;agent mode&amp;quot;, and the ability to connect to &amp;quot;Model Context Protocol&amp;quot; servers which gives you access to a vast array of tools, essentially allowing your agent to access any data, and perform any actions you like. In this post, I&#39;ll walk you through the steps to configure Visual Studio Code to connect to an MCP Server and make use of it in agent mode.

            Organizations are increasingly using multiple large language models (LLMs) when building generative AI applications. Although an individual LLM can be highly capable, it might not optimally address a wide range of use cases or meet diverse performance requirements. The multi-LLM approach enables organizations to effectively choose the right model for each task, adapt to different […]
