            std::generator is a C++23 feature that enables you to write concise, straightforward functions that generate sequences of values on-demand without manually managing state. It builds upon C++20’s coroutines, providing some standard library support for this powerful, but complex, language feature. As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13, we ship an implementation of std::generator in our […]

            Hybrid model orchestration is a powerful technique that AI applications can use to intelligently select and switch between multiple models based on various criteria, all while being transparent to the calling code. This technique not only allows for model selection based on factors such as the prompt’s input token size and each model’s min/max token […]

            Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a […]

            This intelligent document processing solution uses Amazon Bedrock FMs to orchestrate a sophisticated workflow for handling multi-page healthcare documents with mixed content types. The solution uses the FM’s tool use capabilities, accessed through the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. This enables the FMs to not just process text, but to actively engage with various external tools and APIs to perform complex document analysis tasks.

            This post introduces a solution to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing a verified semantic cache using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, which checks if user questions match curated and verified responses before generating new answers. The solution combines the flexibility of LLMs with reliable, verified answers to improve response accuracy, reduce latency, and lower costs while preventing potential misinformation in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.

            In this post, we present the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework as a compound AI system implemented by the DSPy framework. The framework first generates a synthetic dataset from the domain knowledge base and documents for self-instruction, then drives model fine-tuning through SFT, and introduces the human-in-the-loop workflow to collect human and AI feedback to the model response, which is used to further improve the model performance by aligning human preference through reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF).

            本文翻译自Leslie Richardson的New Features for Enhanced Razor Productivity! 如果您现在正在使用 Razor 构建 Web 应用，我们为您带来了一些令人兴奋的新功能，无论您使用的是 Visual Studio 还是 Visual Studio Code，您都会爱上这些新功能！现在，您可以使用名为“将元素提取到新组件”的重构功能，以及全新的基于 Roslyn 的 C# 分词器，这些功能旨在提升您在 Razor 文件中的开发效率。让我们一起来看看吧！ 将元素提取到新组件 将元素提取到新组件是 Visual Studio 17.12 中提供的一项全新的重构功能，它可以自动化创建新 Razor/Blazor 组件的过程。您无需手动创建新文件并复制/粘贴代码，只需选中想要提取的代码（或标签），然后点击灯泡图标并选择将元素提取到新组件即可完成提取操作。该功能让创建可复用组件变得更加简单，有助于保持代码整洁，提高可维护性。 在该功能的首个版本中，提取为组件功能主要支持基础的、以 HTML 为主的代码提取场景。不过，我们计划在未来添加更多改进和支持更高级的场景（例如更一致地处理涉及变量依赖、C# 代码、参数等的提取）。 Roslyn C# 分词器 C# 分词器/词法分析器的更新显著提升了 Razor 对 C# 代码的处理能力。许多用户曾对无法在 Razor 文件中使用原始字符串文本和逐字插值字符串表示失望，而新的 Roslyn C# 词法分析器解决了这一问题！除了对这些字符串格式的支持外，词法分析器还增加了对二进制文本的支持，并改进了对 C# 预处理器指令的处理，确保它们遵循 C# 的规则。最后，新的词法分析器还将更容易支持未来的 C# […]

            In this post, we explore how you can use LLMs with advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate high-quality synthetic data for a finance domain use case. You can use the same technique for synthetic data for other business domain use cases as well. For this post, we demonstrate how to generate counterparty risk (CR) data, which would be beneficial for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are traded directly between two parties, without going through a formal exchange.

            The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is a powerful tool for accelerating application deployment to Microsoft Azure. While azd defaults to Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment, you can configure it to work with HashiCorp Terraform too! This enables azd to be configured not just for Terraform deployments, but also to support cloud-agnostic IaC […] The article Configure Azure Developer CLI (azd) for HashiCorp Terraform Infrastructure Deployment was originally published on Build5Nines.

            Switching from BitConverter.ToString() to Convert.ToHexString() in .NET can significantly enhance performance and reduce memory usage for byte-to-hex conversions. This optimized method is faster and uses less memory, addressing best practices and CA1872 rule violations. For optimal results, consider updating your .editorConfig and exploring additional resources.

            Cloud development environments (CDEs) have become a game-changer for development teams, and for good reason. They simplify workflows, reduce project setup time, and eliminate configuration headaches. While most discussions about CDEs focus exclusively on software developers, in reality, the benefits of CDEs extend far beyond coders. They can boost productivity for every team member involved […]

Our latest Python Developer Survey Results confirm that these three frameworks remain developers’ top choices for backend web development with Python. All three frameworks are open-source and compatible with the latest versions of Python. But how do you determine […]
