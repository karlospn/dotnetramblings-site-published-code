            This article compares two key search methods in dictionaries: using Contains() on the Keys collection and ContainsKey() method directly on the dictionary. It demonstrates examples for both approaches, highlighting Microsoft&#39;s recommendation of using ContainsKey(). The article suggests further examination of the performance aspect of these methods.

            When we build our .NET applications, we commonly use dictionaries to store data as key-value pairs. However, dictionaries do not allow us to map multiple values to a single key. In this article, let’s explore the Lookup class in C# and discuss how we can use it to handle this challenge. Without further ado, let’s […] The post Lookup in C# appeared first on Code Maze.

            A variety of different techniques have been used for returning images relevant to search queries. Historically, the idea of creating a joint embedding space to facilitate image captioning or text-to-image search has been of interest to machine learning (ML) practitioners and businesses for quite a while. Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training (CLIP) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) […]

            In this post, we show you how to accelerate the full pre-training of LLM models by scaling up to 128 trn1.32xlarge nodes, using a Llama 2-7B model as an example. We share best practices for training LLMs on AWS Trainium, scaling the training on a cluster with over 100 nodes, improving efficiency of recovery from system and hardware failures, improving training stability, and achieving convergence.

            Large multimodal models (LMMs) integrate multiple data types into a single model. By combining text data with images and other modalities during training, multimodal models such as Claude3, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro Vision gain more comprehensive understanding and improved ability to process diverse data types. The multimodal approach allows models to handle a wider range […]

            Summary Details Earlier this year, several critical vulnerabilities were discovered in TeamCity. If abused, the flaws might have enabled an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass the authentication checks and gain administrative control of the TeamCity server. All versions of TeamCity On-Premises through 2023.11.3 were affected by these vulnerabilities. Customers […]

            The ability to efficiently search and retrieve documents based on their semantic content has become increasingly important; especially when it comes to building Generative AI systems that implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern. One powerful approach to achieving this is through the use of vector representations of text data, which enables similarity search […] The article Perform Vector Database Similarity Search in .NET Apps using Build5Nines.SharpVector was originally published on Build5Nines.

      <title>Microsoft .NET Code Analysis: Exercise Caution When Employing ContainsKey() with Dictionary Types</title>

            The article highlights the potential performance issues of using ContainsKey() with Dictionary types in Microsoft .NET, advocating for the adoption of TryGetValue() instead. By employing TryGetValue(), the double lookup process is avoided, resulting in improved efficiency and code readability, as demonstrated through benchmark results and recommendations for custom dictionary types.

            Last week I was working on a client project when I ran into a requirement to show a checkbox as part of a form. Pretty straightforward right? However I hit a bit of a stumbling block when I realised I needed to tweak the appearance of the checkbox (to better match the style of the application). It turns out there are limits to how far you can tweak the default checkbox using HTML and CSS.

            Performing base 10 conversions is fundamental when learning basic computer science and mathematical concepts. Since we know computer systems understand binary, such conversions can help us form different number representations that we can use for various applications such as encoding and cryptography. In this article, we will explore the fastest way to convert a base […] The post Fastest Ways to Perform Base 10 Conversions in C# appeared first on Code Maze.

            When you write a Roslyn analyzer, you should also write tests for it. The Roslyn SDK provides a set of NuGet packages that you can use to test your analyzers. In this post, I describe how to test a Roslyn analyzer using the Roslyn SDK NuGet packages. First, Roslyn SDK NuGet packages are not available on NuGet.org. You need to add the following package source to your project file:…

            This content explains the usage of Enums in programming, cautioning against relying solely on Enum values for human-readable names from databases due to potential performance issues. It introduces EnumHelper and EnumExtensions in Spargine, providing methods like GetValues() and GetDescription(). The article also discusses the Enumeration class as a solution to surpass Enum limitations, offering flexibility for custom names and methods like FromDisplayName. This extends Enum functionality and provides more versatility when Enum&#39;s constraints are exceeded.

            The article advocates for initializing reference type static fields inline to enhance code readability and prevent unexpected behavior caused by uninitialized static fields. Microsoft recommends initializing these fields at the point of declaration to improve clarity. The article provides examples demonstrating the issue and the recommended solution, emphasizing the use of static constructors for initialization.
