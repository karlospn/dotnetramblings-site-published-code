            The EU AI Act establishes comprehensive regulations for AI development and deployment within the EU. AWS is committed to building trust in AI through various initiatives including being among the first signatories of the EU&#39;s AI Pact, providing AI Service Cards and guardrails, and offering educational resources while helping customers understand their responsibilities under the new regulatory framework.

            At Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering, we are big fans of integration tests. They are the best way to test that your system works as a whole, but sometimes, integration tests are overkill or too complex to set up that the return on investment is just not worth it. That&#39;s the situation one of our teams has recently found themselves in.

            Developing robust text-to-SQL capabilities is a critical challenge in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and database management. The complexity of NLP and database management increases in this field, particularly while dealing with complex queries and database structures. In this post, we introduce a straightforward but powerful solution with accompanying code to text-to-SQL using a custom agent implementation along with Amazon Bedrock and Converse API.

            Security is a team sport: why everyone owns it now Six security takeaways from Docker’s 2025 State of Application Development Report. In the evolving world of software development, one thing is clear — security is no longer a siloed specialty. It’s a team sport, especially when vulnerabilities strike. That’s one of several key security findings...

            As AI development accelerates, developers need tools that let them move fast without having to reinvent their workflows. Docker Model Runner introduces a new specification for packaging large language models (LLMs) as OCI artifacts — a format developers already know and trust. It brings model sharing into the same workflows used for containers, with support...

            The last few years have made it clear that AI models will continue to be a fundamental component of many applications. The catch is that they’re also a fundamentally different type of component, with complex software and hardware requirements that don’t (yet) fit neatly into the constraints of container-oriented development lifecycles and architectures. To help...

            In the context of distributed systems and microservices architecture, orchestrating communication between diverse components presents significant challenges. However, with the launch of Amazon Bedrock Agents, the landscape is evolving, offering a simplified approach to agent creation and seamless integration of the return of control capability. In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Agents revolutionizes agent creation and demonstrates the efficacy of the return of control capability in orchestrating complex interactions between multiple systems.

Traditional debugging and profiling tools can help you understand what’s happening at specific points in time – but getting a complete picture of system behavior, performance patterns, and architectural relationships often means jumping between external tools and dashboards. We’re building the OpenTelemetry plugin […]

            GitHub Actions doesn&#39;t provide a built-in way to rerun a run automatically. If you have some flakiness in your jobs, this can be a pain as you have to rerun the workflow manually. Hopefully, you can use the workflow_run event to trigger a new workflow when a previous one fails. This allows you to rerun the failed workflow automatically. Note that the following sample workflow will only rerun the failed…
