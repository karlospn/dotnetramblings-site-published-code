            In this post, we set up the custom solution for observability and evaluation of Amazon Bedrock applications. Through code examples and step-by-step guidance, we demonstrate how you can seamlessly integrate this solution into your Amazon Bedrock application, unlocking a new level of visibility, control, and continual improvement for your generative AI applications.

            Although batch inference offers numerous benefits, it’s limited to 10 batch inference jobs submitted per model per Region. To address this consideration and enhance your use of batch inference, we’ve developed a scalable solution using AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB. This post guides you through implementing a queue management system that automatically monitors available job slots and submits new jobs as slots become available.

            Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database service designed to meet the demands of large-scale, low-latency applications. One of the most critical design choices when using Azure Cosmos DB is understanding and effectively using Partition Keys. These keys impact how your data is stored, accessed, and managed across physical servers, directly affecting performance, […] The article Azure Cosmos DB: Understanding Partition Keys was originally published on Build5Nines.

            This post presents a solution where you can upload a recording of your meeting (a feature available in most modern digital communication services such as Amazon Chime) to a centralized video insights and summarization engine. This engine uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services and generative AI on AWS to extract transcripts, produce a summary, and provide a sentiment for the call. The solution notes the logged actions per individual and provides suggested actions for the uploader.

            This post presents an architectural approach to extract data from different cloud environments, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BigQuery, without the need for data movement. This minimizes the complexity and overhead associated with moving data between cloud environments, enabling organizations to access and utilize their disparate data assets for ML projects. We highlight the process of using Amazon Athena Federated Query to extract data from GCP BigQuery, using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to perform data preparation, and then using the prepared data to build ML models within Amazon SageMaker Canvas, a no-code ML interface.

            In this post, we present a framework to customize the use of Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor for handling multi-payload inference requests for near real-time inference scenarios. SageMaker Model Monitor monitors the quality of SageMaker ML models in production. Early and proactive detection of deviations in model quality enables you to take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling.

            In modern .NET applications, dependency injection is a fundamental design pattern that promotes loose coupling and enhances maintainability. At the center of .NET’s dependency injection system lies the IServiceProvider interface, which acts as a service locator for retrieving service instances. Understanding how to obtain and work with an IServiceProvider instance is vital for developers who […] The post How to Get an Instance of IServiceProvider in .NET appeared first on Code Maze.

            In this post, we cover the core concepts behind RAG architectures and discuss strategies for evaluating RAG performance, both quantitatively through metrics and qualitatively by analyzing individual outputs. We outline several practical tips for improving text retrieval, including using hybrid search techniques, enhancing context through data preprocessing, and rewriting queries for better relevance.

            Agentic workflows are a fresh new perspective in building dynamic and complex business use- case based workflows with the help of large language models (LLM) as their reasoning engine or brain. In this post, we set up an agent using Amazon Bedrock Agents to act as a software application builder assistant.

            After careful consideration, we made the decision to discontinue Rekognition people pathing on October 31, 2025. New customers will not be able to access the capability effective October 24, 2024, but existing customers will be able to use the capability as normal until October 31, 2025. This post discusses an alternative solution to Rekognition people pathing and how you can implement this solution in your applications.
