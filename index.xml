            Did you know? The Original Name of .NET Was “Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS)“. Before Microsoft officially named it “.NET,” the platform was internally referred to as NGWS: Next Generation Windows Services. The name “.NET” was adopted in the late 1990s to emphasize the platform’s focus on web-based development and interoperability, as opposed to being […]

            Today, more and more customers are embracing AI with one clear goal in mind: they want to chat with their data. And by “data,” they mean all of it: structured tables, unstructured documents, images, audio, and more. This demand has given rise to hybrid approaches that blend semantic understanding with precise data retrieval. But here’s […]

            In this post, we explore how to use Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build intelligent applications. Unlike traditional vector search, which retrieves documents based on similarity scores, knowledge graphs encode relationships between entities, allowing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve information with context-aware reasoning.

            When a regulatory body like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduces changes to regulations, organizations are required to evaluate the changes against their internal SOPs. When necessary, they must update their SOPs to align with the regulation changes and maintain compliance. In this post, we show different approaches using Amazon Bedrock to identify relationships between regulation changes and SOPs.

This feature was introduced in C# 8.0 and is designed to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors. When the compiler cannot handle all cases, so developers may need to use the null-forgiving operator ! to suppress warnings. This operator tells the…

            When it comes to modernizing enterprise systems in Azure, containerization is the name of the game. But if you’re standing at the crossroads of Azure Container Apps and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the decision isn’t always straightforward. Both options offer robust paths to scalable microservices—but they cater to different levels of control, complexity, and operational […] The article Azure Container Apps vs AKS: Which Is Right for Your Enterprise Application? was originally published on Build5Nines.

            The author reflects on two decades of speaking engagements, emphasizing the importance of soft skills in software engineering over mere technical knowledge. They argue that communication, empathy, and collaboration are crucial for career growth. While major conferences often overlook these topics, community-driven events showcase their value, urging attendees to advocate for more sessions on soft skills.

            Non-conversational applications offer unique advantages such as higher latency tolerance, batch processing, and caching, but their autonomous nature requires stronger guardrails and exhaustive quality assurance compared to conversational applications, which benefit from real-time user feedback and supervision. This post examines four diverse Amazon.com examples of such generative AI applications.

            OpenSearch offers a wide range of third-party machine learning (ML) connectors to support this augmentation. This post highlights two of these third-party ML connectors. The first connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Comprehend connector. In this post, we show you how to use this connector to invoke the LangDetect API to detect the languages of ingested documents. The second connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Bedrock connector to invoke the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2 model so that you can create embeddings from ingested documents and perform semantic search.

            In this post, we demonstrate an example of building an agentic RAG application using the LlamaIndex framework. LlamaIndex is a framework that connects FMs with external data sources. It helps ingest, structure, and retrieve information from databases, APIs, PDFs, and more, enabling the agent and RAG for AI applications. This application serves as a research tool, using the Mistral Large 2 FM on Amazon Bedrock generate responses for the agent flow.

Our solution demonstrates how a team of specialized AI agents can work together to analyze financial news, evaluate stock performance, optimize portfolio allocations, and deliver comprehensive investment insights—all orchestrated through a unified, natural language interface.

            This post explores deploying a text-to-SQL pipeline using generative AI models and Amazon Bedrock to ask natural language questions to a genomics database. We demonstrate how to implement an AI assistant web interface with AWS Amplify and explain the prompt engineering strategies adopted to generate the SQL queries. Finally, we present instructions to deploy the service in your own AWS account.

            Rufus, an AI-powered shopping assistant, relies on many components to deliver its customer experience including a foundation LLM (for response generation) and a query planner (QP) model for query classification and retrieval enhancement. This post focuses on how the QP model used draft centric speculative decoding (SD)—also called parallel decoding—with AWS AI chips to meet the demands of Prime Day. By combining parallel decoding with AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, Rufus achieved two times faster response times, a 50% reduction in inference costs, and seamless scalability during peak traffic.

            In this post, we share how GuardianGamer uses AWS services including Amazon Nova and Amazon Bedrock to deliver a scalable and efficient supervision platform. The team uses Amazon Nova for intelligent narrative generation to provide parents with meaningful insights into their children’s gaming activities and social interactions, while maintaining a non-intrusive approach to monitoring.

            Until now, Qodana linters have run exclusively in Docker containers. While this approach provided consistency and isolation, it also required significant effort for environment configuration, particularly for complex project setups or highly secured systems. Users have had to rely on the bootstrap mechanism to set up custom environments inside the Docker container, often duplicating the […]

            The quality of a project can be measured by having a look at how the code is written. SonarQube can help you by running static code analysis and letting you spot the pain points. Let’s learn how to install and run it locally with Docker.
